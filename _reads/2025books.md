#### 1. [Uncle Tom's Cabin](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/203/pg203-images.html) by Harriet Beecher Stowe <span style="float: right;">`(4/5)`</span>

good book, the whole christian evangelism propaganda was overdone in my opinion, but it is tolerable.

#### 2. [South Sea Tales](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/1208/pg1208-images.html) by Jack London <span style="float: right;">`(3.75/5)`</span>

Some Robinson Crusoesque short stories that I really enjoyed reading. I liked The House of Mapuhi, Mauki, and The Heathen a lot. 

#### 3. [The Call of the Wild](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/215/pg215-images.html) by Jack London <span style="float: right;">`(5/5)`</span>

I love this book so much, for so many reasons. As a child, I used to open this book to the scene where Buck pulls a thousand pounds for John and read it over and over again. Simply wonderful.

#### 4. [White Fang](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/910/pg910-images.html) by Jack London <span style="float: right;">`(5/5)`</span>

my third consecutive Jack London book, I can't get enough of his writing. I wish I read this when I was in school. For me, this is better than The Call of the Wild as far as the writing and story go. I am going to go around for the next few days asking everyone I run into to read this book.

#### 5. [Suicide Notes](https://www.michaelthomasford.com/ya-novels.html) by Michael Thomas Ford <span style="float: right;">`(4/5)`</span>

I hadn't realised how much I missed this sarcastic percy jacksonesque humour until I started reading this book. I finished this in one sitting, which is something childhood me wouldn't really think was anything special but many winters have passed since I read a book cover to cover without stopping.

both the dialogue and monologue are great, the plot kinda darkens and pales simultaneously towards the end but it was still very enjoyable to read. also, the subject matter is clearly dark, and the humour does a very good job of being thoughtful as well as effective.

#### 6. [Night Watch](https://jayneannephillips.com/night-watch/) by Jayne Anne Phillips <span style="float: right;">`(3/5)`</span>

wasn't too bad, although I felt that narration + dialogue were far stronger than descriptions in many places. I have no clue what that Weed character is doing in the book except as a literary device for more exposition, and even that is a weak justification.

I am updating the review on my website a month after reading it, and one thing that stands out is how certain aspects of the book linger on for a long time. The whole Civil War thing, and rustic descriptions of rural America. Very enduring. I can see why it appealed to the Pulitzer folks.

#### 7. [The Financial Lives of the Poets](https://www.jesswalter.com/the_financial_lives_of_the_poets__2009__94357.htm) by Jess Walter <span style="float: right;">`(4/5)`</span>

this writing has some of the best self-deprecating + existentialist humour ever written. some parts would go real viral on substack/blog-screenshot-twitter. the plot gets weak at some places and the ending is lacklustre. almost like it was written in the hope that it would be adapted into a movie.

#### 8. [War and Peace](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2600) by Leo Tolstoy, translated by Louise and Aylmer Maude <span style="float: right;">`(4.75/5)`</span>

there is nothing that hasn't been said before about this, so I wont waste my time. I loved reading the book, it never felt long, or boring, or difficult, or any of the usual excuses people give for not picking it up. The first time I read it, I simply didn't have any historical background to appreciate it, but now I get why Tolstoy wanted to write this book.

Obviously, he has a very strong anti-Napoleon bias, and that put me off in some sections. But can we really blame the Russians for not liking Napoleon? His ideas on history are coherent until the epilogue, and then they get into youtube video-essay script territory. As far as characters go, Napoleon was my favourite (no surprises there) followed by Prince Andrei. Absolutely despised the entire Kuragin clan, and Anna Pavlovna, and Pierre Bezukhov. While the Kuragin's and Anna Pavlovna are just despicable people, Pierre is guilty in that he is a comfort-seeking man, the worst of the lot.

docked a quarter star for all the forced Napoleon hate, Vive l'Empereur!

#### 9. [A Study in Scarlet](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/244/pg244-images.html) by Arthur Conan Doyle <span style="float: right;">`(2.5/5)`</span>

what was that in the middle? the most pointless backstory ever. The Sherlock stuff was cool. but that flashback ruined it all.

#### 10. [Odyssey](https://www.stephenfry.com/store/) by Stephen Fry <span style="float: right;">`(4/5)`</span>

I am rather unfairly partial to the Allen Mandelbaum translation of The Odyssey (because it was the first classic I ever read) and so I am not going to say this was a great retelling or anything.

However, I think Fry's four volumes on Greek Myths are incredibly important for how all-encompassing they are. My first exposure to the Ancient Greek myths and legends was Mandelbaum's translation of the Odyssey, and then I picked up the Robert Graves book on Greek Myths off a shelf in my school library. After reading that, I was so captivated that I searched far and wide for other such books but never found any.

Children now wont have to search farther than the next book in the series. Athena smiles on Stephen Fry.

#### 11. [The Room on the Roof](https://www.google.co.in/books/edition/THE_ROOM_ON_THE_ROOF/1MGC-Iu1yPkC) by Ruskin Bond <span style="float: right;">`(2/5)`</span>

 quaint and nice, but also drawn-out in some places. 

#### 12. [1984](https://www.george-orwell.org/1984) by George Orwell <span style="float: right;">`(5/5)`</span>

This is essential reading. The writing is so powerful, and prescient. One can argue that the idea of the thought police is very far away from most people's concern, especially in light of the recent resurgence of free-speech absolutists. But I think this book is about Fear, and how it paralyzes and eventually snuffs out everything brilliant and unique about humans. I might read Brave New World sometime soon, that one is about Greed.

#### 13. [Napoleon](https://www.andrew-roberts.net/books/napoleon-a-life/) by Andrew Roberts <span style="float: right;">`(5/5)`</span>

the last great man in history

Vive l'Empereur!

#### 14. [Our Oriental Heritage](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Our-Oriental-Heritage/Will-Durant/The-Story-of-Civilization/9781451646689) by Will Durant <span style="float: right;">`(4.5/5)`</span>

Wow it was only near the end of the book when Durant was writing about China did I bother to check when it was written, for there was no mention of Mao. Now that I write this, I should've realized something was off when he didn't write about the Indian Independence. This book was written almost a hundred years ago, that is a very long time back to be writing about history. Especially when so much has happened in the last hundred years. 

A really good book apart from that, the writing is very engaging, and Durant has genuine respect and admiration about the civilizations he writes about. There is a lot of focus on culture and societal description rather than just military/geographical history, and that was super interesting to me. This book can be used as an encyclopedia of history, because of how well it is organized into sections. It allows you to see the big picture, and identify recurring themes and patterns.

I learnt that the word "saw" has an alternative meaning that means "a proverb or maxim". Quoting from page 183 of the book, "so old is the modern saw that we live on one-fourth of what we eat, and the doctors live on the rest."

Some examples of writing I thought were very nice, not directly related to history:

> "the world of beauty and the world of money never touch, even when beautiful things are sold"

> "Men look to love and life for everything; they receive a little less than that; they imagine that they have received nothing: these are the three stages of the pessimist"

> "The very basis of the Higher Man's character is an overflowing sympathy towards all men. He is not angered by the excellences of other men; when he sees men of worth he thinks of equaling them; when he sees men of low worth he turns inward and examines himself, for there are few faults that we do not share with our neighbors. He pays no attention to slander or violent speech. He is courteous and affable to all, but he does not gush forth indiscriminate praise. He treats his inferiors without contempt, and his superiors without seeking to court their favor. He is grave in deportment, since men will not take seriously one who is not serious with them; he is slow in words and earnest in conduct; he is not quick with his tongue, or given to clever repartee; he is earnest because he has work to do—and this is the secret of his unaffected dignity. He is courteous even to his familiars, but maintains his reserve towards all, even his son."

#### 15. [The Life of Greece](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Life-of-Greece/Will-Durant/The-Story-of-Civilization/9781451647587) by Will Durant <span style="float: right;">`(4.75/5)`</span>

I wrote about this in my review of Our Oriental Heritage but as you read this series, you come away, sometimes, with a very indescribable feeling of knowing more than Durant. For example, right away in the first chapter on Crete, Durant writes about an inexplicable period in history when everything in Crete was destroyed, with only ash and debris remaining. But we know now (a severe overstatement) about the Bronze Age Collapse, and how similar symptoms of ruin were observed in all Mediterranean civilizations.

For all my love for Greek mythology and stories, I have never bothered to learn about the history of the Greeks themselves. I think I was very content with imagining them as Homeric individuals fighting wars and feasting while living side by side with the gods. Any history of Greece I know is after only Alexander, and that was more of a cult of personality thing with some military history. While reading this book, I was continually reminded by how much of our culture we owe to the Greeks. Religion, rituals, literature, alphabets, poetry, prose, oratory, essays, drama, art, sculpture, architecture, mathematics, logic, philosophy, and so much more. The West is written under the signature of the Greeks.

This book is great, my favourite parts were the descriptions of art, and architecture and of the individuals across so many centuries. I thought the philosophy stuff was a bit soporific but I dragged on. Now I know a lot about the land and people I've admired from far away for so long.

The word "colophon" comes from a Greek city of the same name. "Greek. *kolophon*, hill; $\rightarrow$ cf. Latin *collis*, $\rightarrow$ English. hill. Because the cavalry of the city was famous for giving the "finishing touch" to a defeated force, the word kolophon became in Greek a synonym for the final stroke, and passed into our language as a publisher's symbol, originally placed at the end of a book."

The word paragraph which is used to denote a block of text pertaining to one topic and marking the differentiation from another topic comes from _paragraphos_ which means a sign written on the side. A horizontal dividing stroke was placed on the side to mark changes in topics.

> "Here under the rubric of athletics we find the real religion of the Greeks — the worship of health, beauty, and strength. "To be in health," said Simonides, "is the best thing for man; the next best, to be of form and nature beautiful; the third, to enjoy wealth gotten without fraud; and the fourth, to be in youth's bloom among friends.""

The phrase _deus ex machina_ which means "god from the machine" is a Roman description of a literal Greek theatre prop wherein playwrights like Euripides made use of a _mechane_ (which was a crane with pulley and weights) to lower a god into a scene who would resolve the plot via divine intervention.

The word hypocrite comes from the Greek word _hypokritēs_ but in a very round-about manner. In a Greek play, the plot is transmitted via a chorus and the actors on stage sort of "react" to the chorus. The word _hypokritēs_ means "answerer" or "replier" and all actors are called this because they "answer" to the chorus. Over time, this word came to mean two-faced because it was associated with actors who play pretend on stage. How cool is that?

> "As Giotto rough-hewed the early path of Italian painting, and Raphael subdued the art with a quiet spirit into technical perfection, and Michelangelo completed the development in works of tortured genius; as Bach with incredible energy forced open a broad road to modern music, and Mozart perfected its form in melodious simplicity, and Beethoven completed the development in works of unbalanced grandeur; so Aeschylus cleared the way and set the forms for Greek drama with his harsh verse and stern philosophy, Sophocles fashioned the art with measured music and placid wisdom, and Euripides completed the development in works of passionate feeling and turbulent doubt. Aeschylus was a preacher of almost Hebraic intensity; Sophocles was a "classic" artist clinging to a broken faith; Euripides was a romantic poet who could never write a perfect play because he was distracted by philosophy. They were the Isaiah, Job, and Ecclesiastes of Greece."

> "The Golden Age (of Greece) ended with the death of Socrates. Athens was exhausted in body and soul; only the degradation of character by prolonged war and desperate suffering could explain the ruthless treatment of Melos, the bitter sentence upon Mytilene, the execution of the Arginusae generals, and the sacrifice of Socrates on the altar of a dying faith. All the foundations of Athenian life were disordered: the soil of Attica had been devastated by the Spartan raids, and the slow-growing olive trees had been burned to the ground; the Athenian navy had been destroyed, and control of trade and the food supply had been lost; the state treasury was empty, and private fortunes had been taxed almost to extinction; two thirds of the citizen body had been killed. The damage done to Greece by the Persian invasions could not compare with the destruction of Greek life and property by the Peloponnesian War. After Salamis and Plataea Greece was left poor, but exalted with courage and pride; now Greece was poor again, and Athens had suffered a wound to her spirit which seemed too deep to be healed."
