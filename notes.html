                                        One of my greatest inspirations. Watching Secrets of the Surface reminded me why
                                        I loved mathematics so much. Her story will live forever.

                                <p>I love the idea of having a sketchbook. In my mind, my sketchbook has yellow coloured
                                    pages, and I've filled it up with hastily drawn lines in treacherous black ink that
                                    glistens like it is alive. I sketch tangled wires, packed bookshelves, Feynman
                                    diagrams, and the calming geometry of airport roof trusses. I'm so tired of
                                    consuming; images, words, ideas, everything. To the point of revulsion. I want to
                                    create. I want to fill every minute with sixty seconds worth of iridescent life.</p>

                                <p>I've resumed my chess practice after months of disinterest and I'm going about it by
                                    playing classical games and analyzing former world champion games to pick up a few
                                    things here and there. I'm starting with Bobby Fischer and my references are two
                                    books: My 60 Memorable Games by the great man himself, and Russians versus Fischer,
                                    which I think I first heard about in an interview by five time world champion
                                    Viswanathan Anand and has stuck with me ever since.</p>

                                <p>Some fun questions I&#39;ve been trying to solve on and off this month.</p>
                                <p>* The Fibonacci numbers count the number of ways a natural number can be expressed as
                                    the sum of 1s and 2s while
                                    considering the order. What is the average number of 1s and 2s needed to create a
                                    sum equal to any natural number?

                                <p>So much of the heavy lifting in the previous note about topographical heights
                                    involved calculating the liquefying
                                    energy needed for a silica molecule. I wanted to expand on that a bit in this note
                                    so I can provide myself closure
                                    about this topic that consumed me for a few hours.</p>
                                <p>

                                <p>All depends on the structure of the silica molecule. In the crystalline form, the
                                    SiO$_2$ lattice has each O atom
                                    bonded to two silicons and each Si atom bonded to four oxygens. For simplicity, we
                                    can consider this configuration
                                    to have zero entropy ($S=0$). In a liquid state, we can think of some fraction
                                    $(f_N)$ of the total molecules ($N$)
                                    being &quot;disordered&quot; by moving into holes, and then the entropy will be
                                    $S=k_B\ln{N\choose f_N}$. Another
                                    simplification ensues after we assume the liquid to be in the highest disordered
                                    state possible and the change in
                                    entropy per molecule will be $\Delta s\sim k_B\ln{2}$.</p>

                                <p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/Si-OCage.svg"
                                        alt="silica structure"></p>
                                <p>There are three steps in the process now, first we need to detach single SiO$_2$
                                    molecules from the lattice, but to
                                    do that, we need to break bonds, or more accurately, overcome the binding energy of
                                    the bonds. Finally, we need to
                                    ask whether it is actually advantageous to completely detach every silica molecule
                                    from the lattice.</p>
                                <p>Each oxygen atom is bounded to one silicon atom in the molecule, but in the lattice,
                                    it is bounded to four silicon
                                    atoms. So we first need to break $3/4$ bonds. But each oxygen atom is part of two
                                    molecules, and so we&#39;re double
                                    counting. Therefore, we only need to break $3/8$ bonds. </p>
                                <p>Next, from high school physics, we remember that breaking a bond at the Bohr radius
                                    of $0.5$ Å is 13.6 eV. Silicon is
                                    on the second row of the periodic table and so we can assume a linear addition of an
                                    angstrom. And because two atoms
                                    form a bond, the binding energy of a single bond is $$E_{b}\sim
                                    Ry\cdot\frac{0.5\text{ Å}}{2\times1.5\text{
                                    Å}}\sim2\text{ eV}.$$
                                    But do we really want the binding energy? Breaking the lattice would mean
                                    converting the crystal to a gas, but
                                    we only want to achieve liquefaction. Assume that bond length changes by some
                                    $p$ % where $p&lt;5$. Then we get
                                    the new binding energy $$E_{b}\sim Ry\cdot\frac{0.5\text{
                                    Å}}{2\times1.5\text{
                                    Å}}\cdot\left(\frac{0.0p}{1.0p}\right)\sim0.1\text{ eV}.$$</p>

                                <p>Earth&#39;s mantle is mostly silicate rock and behaves as a viscous fluid in
                                    geological time (think large time
                                    scales). Oceanic crust and continental crust is primarily formed by partial melting
                                    of the mantle. There&#39;s a
                                    gravitational equilibrium between the crust and the mantle and different
                                    topographical heights exist on earth
                                    because of this static equilibrium. This equilibrium depends on the thickness and
                                    density of the crust. </p>
                                <p>Apparently, the Himalayas are not in isostatic equilibrium (which is a fancy way to
                                    say that they&#39;re still
                                    rising) and mountains primarily rise that high because they&#39;re low density.
                                    Think of this as them being huge,
                                    but having less mass, so they don&#39;t crumble. One important point we&#39;ll come
                                    back to is that mountains fail
                                    at their bases. When a mountain gets too high, they suffer plastic deformation at
                                    the base.</p>
                                <p>There are two major theories of isostasy. One that treats the lithosphere (the crust
                                    basically, but the more you read

                                    densities at different heights. This theory straight up applies Pascal&#39;s Law
                                    (hydrostatic pressure is the same
                                    at the same elevation for a fluid in static equilibrium) to all points in the crust.
                                    The second treats the
                                    lithosphere as an elastic plate that bends and thereby distributes loads.</p>
                                <p>If the maximum height a mountain can reach is $H$, this is the height at which the
                                    energy lost as the mountain
                                    &quot;falls&quot; equals the energy needed to cause plastic deformation at the base.
                                    Doing the computations for each
                                    molecule, we have $$mgh=E_p,$$ where $m=AM$, the atomic mass units in the molecule,
                                    $h=H$, the maximum height before
                                    deformation, and $E_p$ being the energy needed to cause plastic deformation. Note
                                    that Weisskopf uses $E_1$ for
                                    this. To cause plastic deformation, we need to liquefy the molecule without breaking
                                    the atomic structure. This will
                                    require a small fraction ($\epsilon$) of the binding energy $B=\gamma Ry$ where $Ry$
                                    is the Rydberg unit. If we
                                    assume that the mountain is a block of SiO$_2$, the atomic mass will be 60 amu. And
                                    so the maximum height will be
                                    $$H=\epsilon\frac{\gamma Ry}{AMg}\sim \boxed{10\text{ km}}.$$
                                    Later in the paper referenced below, Weisskopf shows a wonderful argument about the
                                    maximum height ($H$) of a topological
                                    structure on a planet being inversely proportional to the third root of the number
                                    of nucleons ($N_p$) in the planet.
                                    $$H\propto\frac{1}{N_p^{1/3}}.$$</p>
                                <p>Update: it turned out that this nucleon argument is neither as fancy or convuluted as
                                    I first thought it would be. <a href="https://rahulgoel.xyz">Rahul Goel</a> pointed
                                    out that
                                    for any object, $V\times\rho=m$ and mass is just the number of nucleons in an
                                    object, and volume is length cubed. And therein lies the intuition for the above
                                    equation. Other questions that were raised in the discussion were 1) How do you know
                                    that plastic deformation is what occurs when mountains fail at their bases and 2) Is
                                    it true that huge mountains usually grow isometrically?</p>

                                <p>Thermometers wouldn&#39;t work if energy didn&#39;t spontaneously flow from two
                                    objects in contact with each other, and temperature is objectively, just something
                                    you measure with a thermometer. (of course, we&#39;re talking about traditional
                                    mercury thermometers here, and not stuff like infrared thermometers)</p>
                                <p>One definition for the average kinetic energy of an ideal gas (with three degrees of
                                    freedom) is $$\bar K=\frac{3}{2}k_BT$$ and we can get a bad definition of
                                    temperature by moving the terms around. Note that we got this equation from the
                                    <strong>equipartition theorem</strong> which states the average energy of a system
                                    in which individual elements have $n$ degrees of freedom is
                                    $\displaystyle\frac{1}{2}nk_BT$.

                                <p>Entropy is a statistical measure of how many possible arrangements exist for a
                                    system. Define multiplicity $\Omega$ for an Einstein Solid with $N$ quantum harmonic
                                    oscillators and $q$ units of energy as $$\Omega={q+N-1\choose q},$$ and energy units
                                    will flow in such a way as to maximize the product of individual multiplicities of
                                    the objects in contact with each other. Concretely, there are systems $A,B$ with
                                    $N_A,N_B$ oscillators and $q_A,q_B$ units of energy in contact with each other. They
                                    have individual multiplicities of $\Omega_A,\Omega_B$ and the units of energy
                                    $q_A,q_B$ will flow in a way that maximizes $\Omega=\Omega_A\cdot\Omega_B.$ The
                                    constraint obviously being that $q_A+q_B$ is always fixed. The graph of $\Omega$
                                    versus $q_A$ looks like a Dirac Delta function with a very narrow peak near the
                                    middle, which is intuitive (if you accept that multiplicities should be maximized,
                                    because the $\displaystyle{n\choose k}$ function has it&#39;s maximum at $2k=n$)</p>
                                <p>Now, entropy is just the natural log of this multiplicity and has units

                                <p>I've always loved the joke where you bite into an apple and find a worm but then you
                                    have to be relieved about it because that is still better than biting into an apple
                                    and finding half a worm. Extending this further, you would prefer half a worm in
                                    your apple than a quarter of a worm. So on and so forth, until it means that the
                                    worst case scenario is when you don't find any worms in your apple.<br><br>

                                    What is worse than finding $1/n$ of a worm in your apple? Finding $1/n^2$ of a worm
                                    in your apple. Hilariously, this works for cases where $n\in\mathbb{R}^+$ except
                                    that the grammar doesn't hold up. Example: for $n=1/7,$ what is worse
                                    than finding 7 worms in your apple? Finding 49 worms in your apple.

                                <p>One of my favourite tricks to minimize errors while doing high school physics was to
                                    use dimensional analysis as a sanity check on all my equations. It is easy to see
                                    that gradient descent is not dimensionally sound, and so I have some thoughts on
                                    whether we can reinvent concepts like loss functions using dimensional analysis of
                                    gradient descent. For example, if we're trying to minimize the loss on a physical
                                    quantity like length, what dimensions would the gradients be, and what dimensions
                                    would the learning rates be. What happens to dimensions in neural networks. This is
                                    something for me to think about and update later. Watch this space!</p>

                                <p>A few days ago I got my hands on a copy of <em>Silman's Complete Endgame Course</em>,
                                    and I'm finally starting to dig into it. I think I'm going to learn a lot from it.
                                    The only endgame book I have really studied before was a slim book by Averbakh
                                    called Chess Endgames: Essential Knowledge, and I really do not think that
                                    Averbakh's book takes you through to master level the way that Silman promises to. I
                                    decided to jump into Silman's book at the class “A” level, because it looked as if I
                                    knew everything in the chapters up to class “B,” but already in the class “A”
                                    chapter there were some things I didn't know.</p>
                                <p>The class “A” chapter starts out with rook and rook-pawn versus rook positions, and
                                    already it has some great stuff. How many open files do you need to free your king
                                    if it is stuck on the eighth rank in front of the pawn? (Four.) How do you draw the
                                    game if you have the rook and your opponent has the rook and rook-pawn, and his rook
                                    is in front of the pawn? If the pawn is on the seventh rank, you want your rook
                                    behind the pawn, of course — that much is obvious. And you have to keep your king on
                                    the opposite side of the board from the pawn — something that is not obvious to a
                                    lot of players.</p>
                                <p>The thing I didn't know is what to do if the pawn is on the sixth rank. Silman shows
                                    that in that case you want your rook attacking the pawn from the side, not from
                                    behind, and he shows something called the Vancura position that I had never heard
                                    of.</p>
                                <p>This is all really cool stuff, but I do have one slight reservation. I've played
                                    loads of games, I believe, without playing a single game that went down to rook and
                                    rook-pawn versus rook. So it's unclear that knowing these endings will make a big
                                    practical difference to me (or to you). Also, the problem with learning rules like
                                    “you need four files between your king and the enemy king” is that in a game, you
                                    usually don't have control over this. The main thing to know is that you want to cut
                                    off the enemy king as far away from the passed pawn as possible. If you can get four
                                    ranks, then great. If you can only get three, then knowing that you need four is not
                                    going to be a big help to you.</p>

                                <p>Basically, a function is differentiable iff it is continuous. Now if there exists a
                                    $k$-th derivative for a function, it means that the function is continuous at least
                                    $k-1$ times. They are using this to group functions into differentiability classes.
                                    A function of class $C^k$ has derivatives $f',f^{\prime\prime},\dots,f^{(k)}.$ Now,
                                    a smooth
                                    function is in the differentiability class $C^{\infty}$ which means that you can
                                    differentiate it as many times as you want. Which means it is always continuous.</p>
                                <p>Now that we know this, we should first try and understand that operator in Terrence
                                    Tao's paper $$\partial_t
                                    u=\Delta u+B(u,u)$$ and he says this $B$ is equivalent to the energy equation. As
                                    far as I understand, Tao doesn't assume the equation to be smooth, instead of
                                    $B(u,u)$ he assumed an averaged $\tilde{B}(u,u).$ And then he constructs a
                                    smooth solution and
                                    demonstrates finite-time blowup.</p>

                                <p>Heat engines convert heat to energy, specifically mechanical energy, which can be
                                    used to move stuff around
                                    $(W=F\cdot\Delta x)$. It does this by using a substance to move things, while
                                    cooling the substance. A heat source
                                    initially heats the substance, the substance moves whatever it needs to move while
                                    losing heat. This substance is
                                    anything that has a heat capacity. Some heat is lost to the surroundings, and there
                                    are practical issues of friction
                                    and drag.</p>
                                <p>Note that heat pumps (refrigerators) do the exact opposite by performing work on a
                                    substance. They usually compress
                                    (do work) on a refrigerant (the working substance) and draw out heat. This is a
                                    diversion I do not wish to explore.

                                <p>Carnot engines operate on the carnot cycle. The Carnot cycle has in order 1)
                                    isothermal expansion, (where it expands
                                    in volume by pulling in heat) 2) adiabatic expansion, (where it loses temperature
                                    because all the heat has to be
                                    dispersed among the expanding molecules) 3) isothermal compression (where it
                                    compresses by expelling heat) and 4)
                                    adiabatic compression where it gains temperature.</p>

                                <p>Lets see what happens if $Q_C=0$ (which means our engine doesn&#39;t lose any waste
                                    heat). Then we&#39;ll have
                                    negative entropy because $\Delta S=\displaystyle\frac{-Q_H}{T_H}<0$ which violates
                                        the second law of thermodynamics. Which means we have to consider waste heat. So
                                        the maximum work we can get is $\Delta W=Q_H-Q_C$. Now, considering both

                                        and we know that $\Delta S>0$. For the entropy to be positive, the minimum value
                                        of $Q_C$ will be
                                        $\displaystyle\frac{Q_H}{T_H}T_C$ and this means that $$\Delta
                                        W=Q_H\left(1-\displaystyle\frac{T_C}{T_H}\right)$$.

                                <p>This means we can&#39;t have 100% efficiency because we can&#39;t exhaust the heat
                                    sink to 0 K, and we will
                                    definitely lose waste heat to the universe due to the second law of thermodynamics.
                                    Also, this is a purely
                                    theoretical concept, taking a Carnot cycle through its steps without losing any
                                    additional energy will require us to
                                    do it infinitely slowly, and it is impractical to build an engine that takes forever
                                    to do its job. Another way to
                                    think of the whole entropy argument before is to look at the S-T diagram and realize
                                    that for the cycle to complete
                                    we need to gain back all the entropy we lost.</p>

                                <p>
                                    I was reading this interesting paper by Hegarty discussing <a
                                        href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0611582">Some explicit constructions of sets
                                        with more sums than differences</a> and I found that the smallest set you could
                                    construct was $\{0,2,3,4,7,11,12,14\}$ and it is not possible to construct smaller
                                    sets (of course, you could create other sets from this one using affine
                                    transformations).<br><br>
                                    For example, take the set $\{2,5,6,8,11\},$ the sumset will be $\{4, 7, 8, 10, 11,
                                    12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, 22\},$ and the difference set will be $\{-9, -6, -5, -4, -3,
                                    -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9\}.$ The sumset has 12 elements and the difference set
                                    has 15 elements, so this set is not an MSTD set.<br><br>
                                    For a set with $n$ numbers, the sumset will have an upper bound of
                                    $\displaystyle\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ and the difference set will have an upper bound of
                                    $n(n-1)+1.$ We
                                    can understand this by drawing a matrix and seeing that for the sumset, we'll have a
                                    symmetric matrix and for the difference set, we'll have a skew-symmetric matrix. We
                                    just need to ignore the zeroes in the diagonal for the difference set. Because we
                                    lose half the numbers from the sum-set, we need to construct MSTD sets by having as
                                    many duplicate values in the difference matrix as possible. An example where both
                                    are equal is the set $\{k,k+1,k+2,\dots,k+l\}$ which has the sumset
                                    $\{2k,2k+1,2k+2,\dots,2k+2l\}$ and the difference set $\{-l,-l+1,-l+2,\dots,l\}.$
                                    Both have a cardinality of $2l+1.$ Another example of a set where both are equal is
                                    the set $\{a, b\}$ where the sumset will have three elements, and the difference set
                                    will have three elements. The sumset will be $\{a+b, 2a, 2b\}$ and the difference
                                    set will be $\{a-b, b-a, 0\}.$

                                            Losing weight requires unlocking
                                            the carbon stored in fat cells, thus reinforcing that often heard refrain of
                                            “eat less, move more.” The authors recommend these concepts be included in

                                    walking very slowly, dying in front and pushing forward behind. And another empire
                                    walked very slowly backward a few
                                    inches a day, leaving the dead like a million bloody rugs. No Europeans will ever do

                                    “That's different. This western-front business couldn't be done again, not for a

                                    could do it but they couldn't. They could fight the first Marne again but not this.
                                    This took religion and years of
                                    plenty and tremendous sureties and the exact relation that existed between the
                                    classes. The Russians and Italians
                                    weren't any good on this front. You had to have a whole-souled sentimental equipment
                                    going back further than you could
                                    remember. You had to remember Christmas, and postcards of the Crown Prince and his
                                    fiancée, and little cafés in Valence
                                    and beer gardens in Unter den Linden and weddings at the mairie, and going to the

                                    whiskers.”<br><br>

                                    “General Grant invented this kind of battle at Petersburg in sixty- five.”<br><br>

                                <p><strong>Theorem:</strong> For all $a,b\in\mathbb{Z},$ with $b&gt;0,$ there exists
                                    unique $q,r\in\mathbb{Z}$ such that
                                    $a=bq+r$ with $0\le r&lt;b$</p>
                                <p><strong>Proof:</strong> Basically, $q$ is the quotient and $r$ is the remainder.
                                    Consider the set
                                    $S={a-bx|x\in\mathbb{Z},a-bx\ge0}$. For this set, we will first choose $a, b$ and
                                    vary $x$ to get elements of the
                                    set.</p>
                                <p>In general, to find the smallest element $r$ in $S$, we have to argue that the set
                                    $S$ is not empty.</p>
                                <p>Claim: $S\neq\phi$<br>
                                    Case 1: $a\ge0$, we set $x=0$, so that we get $a-b(0)=a\in S$. The set is not
                                    empty<br>
                                    Case 2: $a&lt;0$, we will set $x=a$, so that $a-ba=a(1-b)\ge0$. The set is not empty
                                </p>
                                <p>Let $r$ be the minimum value of $S$ and $q$ be the corresponding quotient for this
                                    value of $r$.</p>
                                <p>We have $r=a-bq$. Towards the contradiction, assume that $r\ge b$<br>
                                    $r=a-bq\ge b$<br>
                                    $r-b=a-b(q+1)\ge b-b\ge0$</p>
                                <p>This means that $r-b\in S$ because $r-b=a-b(q&#39;)$ where $q&#39;=q+1$. But on the
                                    other hand, $r-b&lt;r$ which
                                    contradicts our assumption that $r$ is the minimum value of $S$. This implies that
                                    $0\le r&lt;b$</p>
                                <p>Now, all that is left is to prove the uniqueness of $q$ and $r$. Suppose that
                                    $q,q&#39;,r,r&#39;$ are such that
                                    $a=bq+r=bq&#39;+r&#39;$. Assume $r&#39;\ge r$, this assumption can work either ways.
                                    We have $b(q-q&#39;)=r&#39;-r$.
                                    The LHS is a multiple of $b$ and the RHS follows the inequality $o\le
                                    r&#39;-r&lt;b$. The only way both can be true
                                    is if LHS $=$ RHS $=0$. This implies that $q=q&#39;$ and $r=r&#39;$. $\blacksquare$

                                <p>This was an answer I wrote to a friend that asked me how we're supposed to know what
                                    we care about before we choose to work on something? These were my
                                    thoughts...<br><br>The first heuristic that comes to mind is Feynman&#39;s. What do
                                    you find yourself treating like play? I always think
                                    that when you feel like you have to separate &quot;work&quot; from
                                    &quot;free-time&quot;, you&#39;re not doing
                                    something that you care about. Because when you&#39;re working on stuff you care
                                    about, every minute is literally
                                    free time.
                                    Heuristic 1: What we like to play with is what we care about most.</p>
                                <p>There are certain things you can&#39;t do without thinking a few standard deviations
                                    differently to your peers. For
                                    example, academic or industrial research, founding startups, creating art et cetera.
                                    This implies that the barrier
                                    to entry is sufficiently high for these fields of work. Crossing this barrier to
                                    entry implies that you really care
                                    about what you&#39;re doing.
                                    Heuristic 2: An inclination to do things with an unusually high barrier-to-entry.
                                </p>
                                <p>Specific curiosity. Everyone has general curiosity about lots of things, but the
                                    curiosity is usually superficial and
                                    limited to one or two layers of understanding. When you care about something, you
                                    will display specific curiousity.
                                    For example, when I wanted to get better at shooting the football, I asked lots of
                                    people about lots of parameters,
                                    from their weight training regimen to the kind of shinpads they wore in the hope
                                    that I get better at it.
                                    Heuristic 3: You display an intense level of curiousity when you care about
                                    something.</p>
                                <p>Corollary to heuristic 3: The feeling of being a newbie never leaves you when you
                                    care about something. You are
                                    always aware that there&#39;s more to learn.
                                    Heuristic 3.1: You care about things you&#39;re most insecure about.</p>

                                </h3>
                                <p>
                                    You know how the light we see from stars was emitted ages ago and we're only seeing
                                    the past because of the distance.
                                    How do you find out whether a star exists at this moment in time? Because
                                    information can't travel faster than the speed
                                    of light, we are fundamentally constrained.<br><br>

                                    Let's talk about the sun because it's closer to us, and more intuitive to think
                                    about. The sun is 499 light-seconds away
                                    from us (what an annoying number) and we want to find out if the sun actually exists
                                    now or if something happened to it
                                    in the 499 seconds since it last emitted light. One thing we could do is to send
                                    someone up to the sun and report back
                                    with real time updates (ignore the fact that the sun would burn up this person, or
                                    if you can't ignore it, imagine a
                                    heat-proof sensor or something). But this fails because the fastest way the person
                                    would send us the information would
                                    still be slower than the speed of light.<br><br>

                                    After more failed thought-experiments, I thought of one that I can't seem to refute.
                                    Tie someone to a rope that is
                                    exactly the distance between the sun and the earth and fly them out to the sun. When
                                    they reach the sun, the rope will
                                    be taut. Now, when the sun disappears, all this person has to do is to pull on the
                                    rope which will instantly alert us,
                                    499 seconds before things actually go dark suddenly. Obviously, I'm ignoring
                                    something, because nothing actually can
                                    travel faster than the speed of light.<br><br>

                                    What am I missing? The only thing I can think of is that pulling on the rope doesn't
                                    transmit forces instantaneously as
                                    I hope, but why would it not be instantaneous? It's a rope, why will the length or
                                    anything else matter? I'm being
                                    incredibly myopic about something, but can't figure out what.<br><br> Update: It
                                    takes time for an impulse to travel along a physical object. This can be seen with
                                    high-speed differential cameras. I feel like I've won the Nobel Prize for Stupid.

                                    LinkedIn. How many times have I had people I've barely known ask if I could
                                    "connect" (what a repulsive word) on that abomination of a site and I felt every
                                    shred of respect leave my body. LinkedIn needs to be mocked mercilessly for its
                                    assumptions that our worth as humans is solely tied to the work we've done. It needs
                                    to be ridiculed for how it functions as a platform for people to continually debase
                                    themselves in public. It is a humiliation ritual, that people willingly take part
                                    in. Actually, no, scratch that, I don't think there has been a single person that
                                    woke up and went, "let me create a linkedin account today" So what is it? What is it
                                    that makes the most normal person you know get "beyond excited" to tell the world
                                    about their leadership skills or be "thrilled" (seriously, do people even know what
                                    this word means?) to explain how they "create value". The most
                                    honest answer given to me when I asked a friend was that having an
                                    account makes it easier to stalk other people on LinkedIn. At least that&#39;s a
                                    noble cause.</p>
                                <p>Few things are more icky than people using social media to write motivational quotes
                                    and reposting company posts in order to show how much they love their new job. It
                                    just
                                    doesn&#39;t matter, so <a

                                    Notice how short-form video clips taken from longer videos/interviews used to be
                                    clips, then they became clips with
                                    subtitles, then clips with coloured/highlighted subtitles, and now they have
                                    background music or special effects added.
                                    This will only get worse.<br><br>

                                    Short form content is so repulsive to me, it is an incremental commoditization of
                                    our attention. A relentless attack on
                                    our senses, until the baseline is far removed from the norm. I'm going to write an
                                    essay about this if I can sufficiently marshall my attention.

                                <p>
                                    Finished reading The Making of the Atomic Bomb and it's a solid 5/5. Richard Rhodes
                                    gets the balance -between writing
                                    science, and the human stories- perfect. All the brilliant scientists I'd grown up
                                    reading about come together and their
                                    science fits in like a perfect mosaic to split the atom.<br><br>

                                    The chapter on the bombing and effects on the Japanese cities is traumatic to read,
                                    a reminder about man's inhumanity
                                    towards man. Reminded me of Voltaire's, "It is forbidden to kill; therefore all
                                    murderers are punished unless they kill
                                    in large numbers and to the sound of trumpets."<br><br>

                                    When you read Feynman's accounts, you have this impression that life at Los Alamos
                                    revolved around him. So it was
                                    surprising to me that he's only mentioned thrice in the entire book, and only one of
                                    those times, he's described as
                                    doing anything (setting up the radio before the Trinity test)<br><br>

                                    In chronological order, the architects of our understanding of the atom. Democritus,
                                    Aristotle -> Newton, Dalton,
                                    Avogadro -> Thomson -> Rutherford (nucleus) -> Plank, Einstein, Bohr -> Rutherford
                                    (proton), Chadwick -> de Broglie,
                                    Schrödinger, Heisenberg.<br><br>

                                    And for the splitting the atom. Becquerel, Curie, Rutherford -> Fermi -> Hahn,
                                    Meitner, Frisch -> Szilárd -> Bohr,
                                    Anderson -> Teller, Wigner, Einstein-Szilárd -> Roosevelt, Oppenheimer, Groves,

                                <p><strong>Prodromal phase of emesis</strong>: Salivation increases, sometimes a lot,
                                    pupils dilate, heart races, blood vessels constrict, cold sweat. Attention and focus
                                    go down, and fatigue starts to set in. Stomach has electrical activity, and relaxes
                                    to prevent emptying. Oesophagus contracts to pull the stomach into the chest through
                                    the diaphragm (like a funnel). Retrograde giant contraction: small intestine pushes
                                    contents back to the stomach. In the lower small intestine, contents are pushed to
                                    the colon</p>
                                <p><strong>Vomiting act</strong>: Retching involves muscles of the abdomen, oesophagus
                                    and respiratory system, but nothing comes out. During expulsion, intense pressure is
                                    generated in the stomach after the diaphragm and the abdomen contract</p>
                                <p><strong>Nausea</strong>: From the Greek word meaning ship. Intensely aversive, used
                                    in behavioural change therapy (rather controversially). Aside: potatoes during
                                    pregnancy is a bad idea, unless you want your child to have a neural disease.
                                    Pregnancy nausea as a evolutionary defence mechanism, because the embryo is
                                    sensitive to toxins in food. Women with moderate to severe emesis during pregnancy
                                    have lesser miscarriages than women with mild to no emesis. But we don&#39;t know

                                    explanation for why anxiety, or the sight of blood, or the sight of vomit causes
                                    nausea. Injury from sever vomiting can occur: rupture of the oesophagus, lung
                                    collapse, tearing of the spleen. Some doctors think pregnancy sickness is due to
                                    unconscious rejection of pregnancy (originally touted by Freud). Vomiting and nausea
                                    are not connected always, you can have one without the other, considering how common

                                    To understand what LK99 was all about, I was looking at how superconductors work
                                    (revising the basics) and I found out
                                    that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bardeen">John Bardeen</a> came up
                                    with the Theory of Superconductivity. The John Bardeen!
                                    The very same man that invented the Transistor with William Shockley!! He's the only
                                    person to win the Physics Nobel twice.<br><br>

                                    Wow, superconductivity AND the transistor. Where does he stand in the most
                                    influential person of all time rankings?

                                        the man who wandered many paths of exile<br>
                                        after he sacked Troy's sacred citadel.<br>
                                        He saw the cities—mapped the minds—of many;<br>
                                        and on the sea, his spirit suffered every<br>
                                        adversity—to keep his life intact,<br>
                                        to bring his comrades back. In that last task,<br>
                                        he will was firm and fast, and yet he failed:<br>
                                        he could not save his comrades. Fools, they foiled<br>
                                        themselves: they ate the oxen of the Sun,<br>
                                        the herd of Hélios Hypérion;<br>
                                        the lord of light requited their transgression—<br>
                                        he took away the day of their return.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        Muse, tell us of these matters. Daughter of Zeus,<br>
                                        my starting point is any point you choose.<br>

                                        descent to death had reached their homes—released<br>
                                        from war and waves. One man alone was left,<br>
                                        still longing for his home, his wife, his rest.<br>
                                        For the commanding nymph, the brightest goddess,<br>
                                        Calypso, held him in her hollow grottoes:<br>
                                        she wanted him as husband. Even when<br>
                                        the wheel of years drew near his destined time—<br>

                                        to Ithaca—he still could not depend <br>
                                        upon fair fortune or unfailing friends.<br>
                                        While other gods took pity on him, one—<br>
                                        Poseidon—still pursued: he preyed upon<br>
                                        divine Odysseus until the end,<br>
                                        until the exile found his own dear land.

                                    recording (which doesn't constrain
                                    artists to use instruments like guitar and keyboard only). One exception is Sicko

                                    Sebastian and then Lewis and now Max. One car, and usually one driver (that's in

                                <p> Freedom of expression isn't the tool of the powerful; it's the tool of the
                                    powerless. From Caitlin Flanagan's Atlantic article.<br><br>
                                    Malcolm Gladwell pointed out the absurdity of her position by tweeting, “I signed
                                    the Harpers letter because there were
                                    lots of people who also signed the Harpers letter whose views I disagreed with. I
                                    thought that was the point of the
                                    Harpers letter.”
                                    Whenever a society collapses in on itself, free speech is the first thing to go.
                                    That's how you know we're in the
                                    process of closing up shop. Our legal protections remain in place—that's why so many

                                    piñata to such effect—but the culture of free speech is eroding every day. Ask an
                                    Oberlin student—fresh outta Shaker
                                    Heights, coming in hot, with a heart as big as all outdoors and a 3 in AP Bio—to
                                    tell you what speech is acceptable, and
                                    she'll tell you that it's speech that doesn't hurt the feelings of anyone belonging
                                    to a protected class.

                                <p>Today, we went to Citi Neuro Hospital with everyone taking the Medical Image Analysis
                                    course. There were ten of us
                                    and we booked an SUV to the place. The air was super hot outside the campus, and the
                                    first thing I noticed about
                                    Hyderabad was how undulating the terrain was. Apart from small areas of the city,
                                    most of it is super uneven. The
                                    place we went to, Banjara Hills, is literally that, hilly. Some parts of the roads
                                    were like roller-coasters, steep
                                    and winding.</p>
                                <p>Banjara Hills as a residential area is pretty posh, and I definitely might have seen
                                    some A-list celebrity homes
                                    while I passed them. We went to the hospital and I took out my mask (haha). Everyone
                                    else had to buy masks. I wish I
                                    looked more closely at the patients (the hospital was CROWDED) because this
                                    wasn&#39;t like a usual hospital, it was
                                    for neuro disorders, so I&#39;m sure the patients would be remarkedly different. In
                                    general hospitals, people
                                    usually look pained, and in suffering. Anyways.</p>
                                <p>Dr. D. Ravi Varma who&#39;s part of the board (and he probably owns the hospital)
                                    came out to receive us. The staff
                                    and the patients gave us a wide berth when they saw who we were with. He took us
                                    first to the X-ray room. It was
                                    kinda fancy, he showed us how the walls were super thick so that radiation
                                    wouldn&#39;t leak outside, and then I saw
                                    that some walls had water seeping through them and I looked very suspiciously at
                                    that for a while. Because I was
                                    trying to think whether water would be affected by X-rays in any way. The X-ray
                                    machine was super sophisticated, it
                                    could move in two directions (say X-axis and Y-axis) and could rotate along one
                                    plane.</p>
                                <p>The room had provisions for a full body X-ray (where the patient has to lie down) and
                                    for a chest X-ray (where the
                                    patient has to stand, much like Roentgen&#39;s wife in the original X-ray
                                    experiments). I didn&#39;t really
                                    understand why the two are so different, even though he said something about
                                    magnification. The operator stands
                                    behind a lead frame? (the right word evades me at the moment) and the glass he sees
                                    through also has lead in it.
                                    There was a heavy (I tried it on, it is heavy) lead apron for pregnant women so that
                                    the foetus is not harmed.</p>
                                <p>Then we went to CT, the machine costs 1.2 crores, and they&#39;re planning to replace
                                    it with a machine that costs 3
                                    crores. CT was pretty uneventful, except that I saw a warning on the CT machine that
                                    warned technicians to not put
                                    their fingers in the machine. I mean, some idiot must have done that for the machine
                                    to come with that warning.
                                    Also, for angiography, they use iodine (which is super dense) in order to mark out
                                    blood flow. But the body only
                                    wants limited quantities of iodine, and injecting that much iodine is super bad. So
                                    they tie up iodine in a molecule
                                    called iodohex? me forgot :(</p>
                                <p>Then we went underground, which really puzzled me, because the hospital was like 5
                                    stories high or something. Guess
                                    why? These MRI machines are so heavy, so heavy, that the roof would fall on your
                                    head if you placed it on standard
                                    slabs. Being a civil engineer, you could see how interested I was in all this. 6
                                    tonnes, is how heavy the machine
                                    is. And the machine was a thing of beauty. Physics and engineering in perfect tango.
                                    We had to remove all metallic
                                    objects and we went inside. There were pictures of the beach inside in all
                                    directions to help claustrophobic
                                    patients. I asked how many claustrophobic patients he gets, and he said, VERY
                                    SURPRISINGLY TO ME, that almost all
                                    the patients he gets are claustrophobic.</p>
                                <p>We spent so much time with the MRI machine, Ingenia 3.0 Tesla by Philips. It has some
                                    3 million miles of wire about 2
                                    micron thick running with some huge current to generate the magnetic field. The
                                    current is sustained by ensuring
                                    superconductivity of the material, liquid Helium is sustained at 4K (-269 C) by
                                    using a heavy Carnot engine, that
                                    pumps so loudly that the room vibrates constantly (thud, chain click, thud, chain
                                    click). The patient is given a
                                    pair of pneumatic headphones (which are super awesome, they convert digital sound to
                                    pneumatic sound, and the inside
                                    of the wires have loads of cilia, which propagate the sound) so that they&#39;re not
                                    affected by the magnet. I wish
                                    I asked if the patients could choose their own music.</p>
                                <p>I was fascinated by the warnings, and the backups, and the backups to the backups
                                    they had. One warning near the MRI
                                    machine showed a person being sucked into the machine because they got too close
                                    with their wheelchair, the drawing
                                    was hilarious. There were 3 separate buttons to turn off the magnet in case of such
                                    a situation. Apparently, turning
                                    of the magnet and turning it back on will cost, wait for it, drum roll, 2 crores.
                                    Self-explanatory no? THAT IS MORE
                                    THAN THE CT MACHINE.</p>
                                <p>Phew, once, they lost power supply to the machine because of some circuit breaker. An
                                    MCB, it didn&#39;t break all
                                    the way and got stuck in the middle, and because of that, they didn&#39;t get power
                                    from either the electricity
                                    board or their generator, and the machine turned off. Since then, they have
                                    installed a protocol where they have
                                    sensors that always tell them whether the board is giving them power or not. And if
                                    that protocol fails, the chief
                                    doctor (Ravi Varma in this case) has a direct line to the EB (electricity board) in
                                    charge with priority. All rather
                                    important stuff.</p>
                                <p>When I said underground, you should have thought of what I said earlier, that we were
                                    in Banjara Hills. The hospital
                                    has been built into a hill. Dug into rock, I wonder how stable the building really
                                    is. It has been 7 years, and I
                                    definitely did see some cracks in some corners. He then showed us how fast his
                                    computing machines were (they have
                                    state of the art GPUs to get instantaneous reconstructions in 3D, and in super high
                                    resolution), their data center,
                                    which gets filled by 1TB a year (that is unreal) because of all the high-quality
                                    images they store. That is that, I
                                    don&#39;t think I&#39;ve forgotten anything else. One funny thing that happened was
                                    one student asked him how long
                                    the generator runs, and he replied rather drily, &quot;as long as we pour diesel
                                    into it&quot;. </p>
                                <p>I found it cool, how well-versed he was with the physics, the engineering, the
                                    computation, the algorithms, and the
                                    logistics of his hospital. He&#39;s a doctor, and he&#39;s the first one I&#39;ve
                                    seen that I would never guess was
                                    a doctor unless he told me.</p>

                                <p> Patients with amnesia or agnosia usually answer questions by cues rather than
                                    memory, a sort of inference. For example, identifying the month by looking out the
                                    window and identifying platonic solids by feeling them. Is the loss in these pattern

                                    with perfect play! It seems obvious now, that I need to move the white king all
                                    over
                                    to f6, while guarding the c pawn with the bishop. Then black's bishop will be
                                    overloaded trying to defend the f pawn and also prevent the h pawn from moving
                                    up.
                                    But I drew this position while actually playing it by giving away my h pawn
                                    after
                                    which the position is equal, even though white has a pass pawn.

                                    After completing an undergraduate degree in mathematics at Sharif University in
                                    Tehran in 1999, Mirzakhani went to graduate school at Harvard University, where
                                    she started attending McMullen's seminar. At first, she didn't understand much
                                    of what he was talking about but was captivated by the beauty of the subject,
                                    hyperbolic geometry. She started going to McMullen's office and peppering him
                                    with questions, scribbling down notes in Farsi.<br><br>

                                    “She had a sort of daring imagination,” recalled McMullen, a 1998 Fields
                                    medalist. “She would formulate in her mind an imaginary picture of what must be
                                    going on, then come to my office and describe it. At the end, she would turn to
                                    me and say, 'Is it right?'' I was always very flattered that she thought I would
                                    know.”

                                <p>The Hellespont is the ancient name for the Dardenelles Straits, they separated
                                    Europe from Asia. Alexander crossed the Hellespont from Greece and threw his
                                    spear into Persian soil, thereby declaring war on the Achaemenid Persian Empire.
                                    Personally, I think this act was what defined Alexander. Alexander could have
                                    stayed home in Greece, raised a family, been a great king, and died a celebrated
                                    man. But this was not him. By crossing the Hellespont and daring to invade
                                    Persia, he transcended his mortality. It is a reminder to me that I have a
