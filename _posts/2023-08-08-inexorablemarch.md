Can someone tell me where the phrase, "the inexorable march of time" originated? I absolutely love it, but can't seem to find who came up with it. G. K. Chesterton has "relentless march of time" and Walt Whitman has "long march of time".

I am at my wits' end...

Update: I asked this on Mathstodon, and Prof. Michael Kinyon from the University of Denver found an 1876 reference by a [R. W. Shufeldt](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/63279/63279-h/63279-h.htm) of the U. S. Navy.
