Reading and implementing the Seam Carving paper. In this video, I write the energy function and test it on a bunch of diverse images. I also explain the energy function and the formal definition of a seam. A seam is a path of pixels that is removed from the image. The energy function is a function that assigns a value to each pixel in the image. The value is a measure of how important the pixel is to the image. The seam is the path of pixels with the lowest energy. The seam is removed from the image and the image is resized. This video is also a code walkthrough of how to read the paper and translate it into code.
