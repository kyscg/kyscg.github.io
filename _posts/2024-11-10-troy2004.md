These are some lines that I think go really hard. These are not quotes from the Iliad (Zeus forbid) but lines from the movie screenplay.

<blockquote>
    <p>This will be the greatest war the world has ever seen. We need the greatest warrior.</p>
    <cite>â€” Nestor to Agamemnon about Achilles</cite>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p> Achilles: They'll be talking about this war for another thousand years.<br>
Hector: In a thousand years, the dust from our bones will be gone.<br>
Achilles: Yes prince. But our names will remain.</p>
</blockquote>

>  page: Are the stories true? They say your mother was an immortal goddess. They say you can't be killed.<br>
>  Achilles: I wouldn't be bothering with the shield then, would I?<br>
>  page: The Thessalonian you're fighting... he's the biggest man I've ever seen. I wouldn't want to fight him.<br>
>  Achilles: That's why no one will remember your name.
