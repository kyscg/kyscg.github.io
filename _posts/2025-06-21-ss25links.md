- [Against 3x speed](https://perell.com/essay/against-3x-speed/) by David Perell (this was sent to me by a friend as a response to my [Javascript trick to go faster than 2x](https://kyscg.github.io/2025/04/07/videoplaybackspeed.html))

- [Terence Tao livecoding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyyR7j2ChCI) the formalization of a proof in Lean. Wow, just wow!
- TIL that we don't really understand [how the earth started rotating](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/ur1b50/what_caused_the_earths_rotation_and_what_dictated/), and what set its rotational velocity.
	- "The most plausible explanation is the hypothesis that a Mars-sized planet (which they named Theia) smacked us at a particular velocity/angle/location around 4 1/2B years ago--most likely twice, a few hundred thousand years apart."
	- "And our remarkably large Moon (relative to Earth) formed by this impact stabilizes Earth on its polar axis. Otherwise Earth's axial wobble would be much greater."
	- "And Theia's iron core merged with ours, giving us a stronger Van Allen belt, which prevents the surface of the Earth from being bombarded by anywhere near as much radiation as would be the case otherwise."
- Related to the above, a very nice explanation about [why the earth will never be tidally locked to the sun](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/13fke2/comment/c73l5u0/).

- [What makes four dimensions special?](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/47569/what-makes-four-dimensions-special)
	-  "I remember attending two lectures by M. Gromov that began by the remark that not only 4 equals 2 plus 2, but this equality is true in 3 different ways (meaning that there are three equipartitions in two classes of a 4-element set). According to him, a lot of exceptional behaviors in math stem from this, especially from the fact that 3 < 4 (it definitely explains why the alternating group A(4) isn't simple, but Gromov also mentioned the gauge-theoretic oddities in dimension 4)."
