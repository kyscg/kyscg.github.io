Notice how short-form video clips taken from longer videos/interviews used to be clips, then they became clips with subtitles, then clips with coloured/highlighted subtitles, and now they have background music or special effects added. This will only get worse.

Short form content is so repulsive to me, it is an incremental commoditization of our attention. A relentless attack on our senses, until the baseline is far removed from the norm. I'm going to write an essay about this if I can sufficiently marshall my attention.
