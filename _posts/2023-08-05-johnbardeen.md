To understand what LK99 was all about, I was looking at how superconductors work (revising the basics) and I found out that [John Bardeen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bardeen) came up with the Theory of Superconductivity. The John Bardeen! The very same man that invented the Transistor with William Shockley!! He's the only person to win the Physics Nobel twice.  
  
Wow, superconductivity AND the transistor. Where does he stand in the most influential person of all time rankings? (a list on which Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie surely features)
