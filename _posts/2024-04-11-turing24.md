Avi Wigderson has won the [2023 Turing Award](https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/wigderson_3844537.cfm) "for foundational contributions to the theory of computation, including reshaping our understanding of the role of randomness in computation and mathematics, and for his decades of intellectual leadership in theoretical computer science"  
  
Avi also won the 2021 Abel Prize! Making him the first person to hold the double (me when?). Probability is having its moment in the sun this spring.
