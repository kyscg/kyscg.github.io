If you can keep your head when all about you \
&nbsp; &nbsp;Are losing theirs and blaming it on you; \
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, \
&nbsp; &nbsp;But make allowance for their doubting too: \
_If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,_ \
&nbsp; &nbsp;Or being lied about, don't deal in lies, \
Or being hated don't give way to hating, \
&nbsp; &nbsp;And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise;

_If you can dream—and not make dreams your master; \
&nbsp; &nbsp;If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim, \
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster \
&nbsp; &nbsp;And treat those two impostors just the same:_ \
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken \
&nbsp; &nbsp;Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools, \
_Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken, \
&nbsp; &nbsp;And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools_;

_If you can make one heap of all your winnings \
&nbsp; &nbsp;And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss, \
And lose, and start again at your beginnings \
&nbsp; &nbsp;⁠And never breathe a word about your loss: \
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew \
&nbsp; &nbsp;To serve your turn long after they are gone, \
And so hold on when there is nothing in you \
&nbsp; &nbsp;⁠Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'_

_If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, \
&nbsp; &nbsp;Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch, \
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you, \
&nbsp; &nbsp;If all men count with you, but none too much: \
If you can fill the unforgiving minute \
&nbsp; &nbsp;With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,_ \
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it, \
&nbsp; &nbsp;⁠And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son!
