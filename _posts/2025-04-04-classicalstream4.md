Recording of me playing a 30 + 20 game against g4lois (such a cool username) on LiChess. I make no major mistakes out of the Smith-Morra Declined and get into the middlegame. Black makes a mistake and is left with no pieces to have counterplay.

This game was about using the knights well. Black had very well positioned knights but they did not make use of the central control while my knight controlled large areas of the board because of how uncoordinated black's pieces were. Overall, it was a comfortable win and I was never in any great trouble.
