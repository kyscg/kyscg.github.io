[Olympics Medals per Capita](https://www.medalspercapita.com/) measures the number of Olympic medals won by a country relative to its population. They also have a weighted measure, and another metric relative to the GDP of the country. All of these metrics are better than raw medal tally. They have a description in their 'about' page which goes:

> As you scan the Olympic medal tally, one thing stands out: larger countries tend to win more medals. There are a few notable exceptions, though, including New Zealand, which wins many more medals than you'd expect of a country its size.

However, they are very kind to India, which is definitely an exception, seeing how we regularly have nothing to show for our booming population. We need to get an award for transcending the law of averages by not even accidentally producing a good bunch of Olympic athletes over the last thirty odd years.
