I've resumed my chess practice after months of disinterest and I'm going about it by playing classical games and analyzing former world champion games to pick up a few things here and there. I'm starting with Bobby Fischer and my references are two books: My 60 Memorable Games by the great man himself, and Russians versus Fischer, which I think I first heard about in an interview by five time world champion Viswanathan Anand and has stuck with me ever since.
