I'm publishing this in 2025, with some added context, and hence the use of past tense.

Notes for a lecture I gave at IIT Roorkee on Binary Search Trees. After motivating the need for the data structure using a runway reservation system problem, I introduce tree terminology and the basic operations on a binary search tree. Also discussed are the ordering invariant and rounding-up with minor algorithms and runtime technicalities.
