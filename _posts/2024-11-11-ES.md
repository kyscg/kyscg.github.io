## Español

- *lo sé* means I know it, whereas *yo sé* means I know. Use the former when we want to say that we specifically know something, and the latter in general. Although, practically, both are used interchangeably, sometimes just as *sé*.
- *trabaja* is “you work” *trabaje* is “work” (as a command) *trabajé* is “I worked”.
- _ir de_ means "to go" and _voy_ is "i go"
- _entender_ means to get an idea about something, but _comprender_ means to completely understand something
