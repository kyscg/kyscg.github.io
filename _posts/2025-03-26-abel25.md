Masaki Kashiwara has won the [2025 Abel Prize](https://abelprize.no/abel-prize-laureates/2025) "for his fundamental contributions to algebraic analysis and representation theory, in particular the development of the theory of D-modules and the discovery of crystal graphs."  

I don't really understand the mathematics, but I am putting it here because I think it's cool and with the hope that someone someday asks me about it, and I am then, forced to read about it.
