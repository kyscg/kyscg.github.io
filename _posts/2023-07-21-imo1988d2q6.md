<p> Let $a, b\in\mathbb{Z}^{+}:ab+1 | a^2+b^2.$ Show that
$\displaystyle\frac{a^2+b^2}{ab+1}=r^2$
where $r\in\mathbb{Z}$.<br><br> I figured out that the solutions were $a=n,b=n^3,$
and then concluded falsely that that was it. Turns out there are infinitely more and
the only reason that $(n,n^3)$ shows up as the first solution is a coincidence of
the complete proof.<br><br> Zvezdelina Stankova explains on <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcaYEaVTA4g">Numberphile</a> one solution
that uses induction â€” with infectious enthusiasm. This problem consumed me, and its
insides were wondrous.
