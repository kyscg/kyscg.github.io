Seb drove Ayrton Senna's McLaren MP4/8 in Imola before the race last night. What a magnificent beast that car is, the wail of the naturally aspirated V8 strikes straight into the heart. The gunshot sounds while the car downshifts are beautiful. Seb is probably the best driver to do this stuff, not only does he have tremendous respect for the history of the sport and its legends, he genuinely loves racing in those cars. He was properly throwing the car into every corner around the circuit. But the best part was when he brought out the Brazilian and Austrian (for Roland Ratzenberger) flags. He held out the flags, and proceeded to drive two laps steering with one hand. He was just twenty seconds off the pace too!! He talks about how it felt in the cockpit and why he got out the flags in [the interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5ST1OPDyDA) just after he did donuts on the main straight and gave 2013 Indian GP flashbacks by bowing to the car.
