<p>Earth&#39;s mantle is mostly silicate rock and behaves as a viscous fluid in
geological time (think large time
scales). Oceanic crust and continental crust is primarily formed by partial melting
of the mantle. There&#39;s a
gravitational equilibrium between the crust and the mantle and different
topographical heights exist on earth
because of this static equilibrium. This equilibrium depends on the thickness and
density of the crust. </p>

<p>Apparently, the Himalayas are not in isostatic equilibrium (which is a fancy way to
say that they&#39;re still
rising) and mountains primarily rise that high because they&#39;re low density.
Think of this as them being huge,
but having less mass, so they don&#39;t crumble. One important point we&#39;ll come
back to is that mountains fail
at their bases. When a mountain gets too high, they suffer plastic deformation at
the base.</p>

<p>There are two major theories of isostasy. One that treats the lithosphere (the crust
basically, but the more you read
about it, the more you want to use the scientifically precise term) as a sheet
floating on the mantle with different
densities at different heights. This theory straight up applies Pascal&#39;s Law
(hydrostatic pressure is the same
at the same elevation for a fluid in static equilibrium) to all points in the crust.
The second treats the
lithosphere as an elastic plate that bends and thereby distributes loads.</p>

<p>If the maximum height a mountain can reach is $H$, this is the height at which the
energy lost as the mountain
&quot;falls&quot; equals the energy needed to cause plastic deformation at the base.
Doing the computations for each
molecule, we have $$mgh=E_p,$$ where $m=AM$, the atomic mass units in the molecule,
$h=H$, the maximum height before
deformation, and $E_p$ being the energy needed to cause plastic deformation. Note
that Weisskopf uses $E_1$ for
this. To cause plastic deformation, we need to liquefy the molecule without breaking
the atomic structure. This will
require a small fraction ($\epsilon$) of the binding energy $B=\gamma Ry$ where $Ry$
is the Rydberg unit. If we
assume that the mountain is a block of SiO$_2$, the atomic mass will be 60 amu. And
so the maximum height will be
$$H=\epsilon\frac{\gamma Ry}{AMg}\sim \boxed{10\text{ km}}.$$
Later in the paper referenced below, Weisskopf shows a wonderful argument about the
maximum height ($H$) of a topological
structure on a planet being inversely proportional to the third root of the number
of nucleons ($N_p$) in the planet.
$$H\propto\frac{1}{N_p^{1/3}}.$$</p>

<p>Update: it turned out that this nucleon argument is neither as fancy or convuluted as
I first thought it would be. <a href="https://rahulgoel.xyz">Rahul Goel</a> pointed
out that
for any object, $V\times\rho=m$ and mass is just the number of nucleons in an
object, and volume is length cubed. And therein lies the intuition for the above
equation. Other questions that were raised in the discussion were 1) How do you know
that plastic deformation is what occurs when mountains fail at their bases and 2) Is
it true that huge mountains usually grow isometrically?</p>
