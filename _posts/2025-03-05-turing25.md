[Andrew Barto](https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/barto_9471663.cfm) and [Rich Sutton](https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/sutton_0160594.cfm) have won the Turing Award "for developing the conceptual and algorithmic foundations of reinforcement learning."

This selection would've been particularly close to Alan Turing's heart because he laid out a learning system that would use rewards and feedback in his wonderful paper, "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" which starts off with the most ambitious question in the last century, "_I propose to consider the question, 'Can Machines Think?'_"

Also, I love their Reinforcement Learning book so much that I wouldn't have minded a bit if they got the award simply for the educational value of that book.
