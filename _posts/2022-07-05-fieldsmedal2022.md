- James Maynard for distances between primes, existence of infinite decimal representations of primes with no digit 7 (or any other digit).
- Maryna Viazowska for <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.04246">sphere packing in eight dimensions.</a>
- June Huh for proof that absolute values of coefficients in chromatic polynomials are unimodal and log-concave. (chromatic polynomial for a complete graph is $x(x-1)(x-2)\cdots(x-n+1),$ for a graph with no edges is simply $x^n,$ and for a tree on $n$ vertices is $x(x-1)^{n-1}$)
