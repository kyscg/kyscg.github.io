> Of all evil I deem you capable: therefore I want the good from you. Verily, I have often laughed at the weaklings who thought themselves good because they had no claws.

If you don't have the courage to commit a crime, it doesn't mean you're moral for not committing a crime. It just means you're afraid of doing it. We can see this in mob violence, people riot and loot during protests because they don't think they'll get caught.
