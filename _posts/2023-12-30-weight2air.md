<ul>
<li>
<p>People who wish to lose weight while maintaining their fat-free mass are,
biochemically speaking, attempting
to metabolise the triglycerides stored in their adipocytes. The three most
common fatty acids stored in human adipose tissues are
<strong>oleate</strong>
(C<sub>18</sub>H<sub>34</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), <strong>palmitate</strong>
(C<sub>16</sub>H<sub>32</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), and <strong>linoleate</strong>
(C<sub>18</sub>H<sub>32</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), which all esterify to form
C<sub>55</sub>H<sub>104</sub>O<sub>6</sub>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The complete oxidation of a single triglyceride molecule involves many
enzymes and biochemical steps, but the
entire process can be summarised as:
<strong>C<sub>55</sub>H<sub>104</sub>O<sub>6</sub>+78O<sub>2</sub>→55CO<sub>2</sub>+52H<sub>2</sub>O+Energy</strong>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stoichiometry shows that complete oxidation of 10 kg of human fat requires 29
kg of inhaled oxygen producing
28 kg of CO<sub>2</sub> and 11 kg of H<sub>2</sub>O. This tells us the
metabolic fate of fat but remains
silent about the proportions of the mass stored in those 10 kg of fat that
depart as carbon dioxide or water
during weight loss.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To calculate these values, every atom's pathway out of the body was traced
using labelled heavy oxygen
(O<sup>18</sup>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A triglyceride's six oxygen atoms will therefore be shared by CO<sub>2</sub>
and H<sub>2</sub>O in the same
<strong>2:1 ratio</strong> in which oxygen exists in each substance. In
other words, four will be exhaled
and two will form water. Note that the Da stands for dalton, a unit of mass.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The proportion of oxygen that becomes CO<sub>2</sub> is <strong>(661 Da
(C<sub>55</sub>)+64 Da
(O<sub>4</sub>))/(861 Da
(C<sub>55</sub>H<sub>104</sub>O<sub>6</sub>))$\times$100=84%</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The proportion of mass that becomes water is <strong>(105 Da
(H<sub>104</sub>)+32 Da (O<sub>2</sub>))/(861 Da
(C<sub>55</sub>H<sub>104</sub>O<sub>6</sub>))$\times$100=16%</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Calculations show that the lungs are the primary excretory organ for fat.
Losing weight requires unlocking
the carbon stored in fat cells, thus reinforcing that often heard refrain of
“eat less, move more.” The authors recommend these concepts be included in
secondary school science
curriculums and university
biochemistry courses to correct widespread misconceptions about weight loss.
