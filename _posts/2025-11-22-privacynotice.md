This policy is effective as of **November 22, 2025**.

* **No Direct Personal Data Collection:** This website does not directly collect, store, or process any personally identifiable information (PII) such as your name, email address, or IP address in a personally identifiable format.
* **No Registration or User Accounts:** This website does not offer user registration or accounts, meaning you are not required to provide any personal data to use this website.

## 2. Third-Party Services and Data Handlers

This website uses a few trusted third-party services to provide analytics and interactive features. These services have their own privacy policies which you are encouraged to review.

| Service | Purpose | Data Collected by Third Party | Link to Privacy Policy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

#### 2.1 Analytics (Umami)
This website uses [Umami](https://umami.is/) for website analytics. Umami is a **privacy-focused, self-hosted analytics solution**.
* **Data Collected:** Umami collects website usage data, such as the pages you visit, the duration of your visit, and the referral source.
* **Non-Identifying:** Umami's goal is to track traffic *without* tracking individuals. It does not use cookies, and it **anonymizes all data collected**. Specifically, it hashes the visitor's IP address with a unique salt to ensure it cannot be linked back to an individual user. **No IP addresses are stored.**

#### 2.2 Comments (Utterances)
This website uses [Utterances](https://utteranc.es/) to provide a comment section on blog posts.
* **GitHub Integration:** Utterances is an open-source commenting system built on **GitHub Issues**. It requires you to be logged into your **GitHub account** to leave a comment.
* **Data Stored:** When you comment, the content of your comment, your GitHub username, and a link to your GitHub profile are stored as a public issue on the website's GitHub repository. This data is handled according to **GitHub's Privacy Statement**.

This website does not collect or store your GitHub credentials. It simply uses the publicly available data from the GitHub Issue system to display the comments.

#### 2.3 Third-Party Embedded Content

Some pages on this website may include embedded content (e.g., videos, tweets, code snippets). These embeds behave in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the source website directly.

These third-party services may potentially collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, especially if you have an account and are logged in to that service.

Examples of third-party embeds used include:
* **Twitter/Mastodon:** For social media posts.
* **GitHub Gists:** For embedding code snippets.
* **LiChess:** For interactive chess content.
* **YouTube:** For videos.

By interacting with an embed (e.g., playing a video or liking a tweet), you are directly engaging with the privacy policies of the respective third party.

## 3. Data Storage, Security, and Retention

* **Hosting:** This website is hosted via **GitHub Pages**. Data storage is governed by GitHub's policies.
* **Retention:** Anonymized Umami analytics data is retained indefinitely for historical trend analysis. Comments remain public on the associated GitHub repository for as long as the website exists.
* This website does not use your data for marketing purposes.

## 4. Changes to This Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. All updates will live on this page, with clear information about changes. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
