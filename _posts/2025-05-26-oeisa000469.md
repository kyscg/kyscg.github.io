I was thinking of a sequence of numbers that would have only one prime factor each. So for example, $6=2\times3$ and $30=2\times3\times5$ would qualify but $12=2\times2\times3$ would not because $2$ appeared more than once in the prime factorization. I wrote down a few terms $(6, 10, 14, 15, 21, 22, 26, 30, 33, 34, 35, 38)$ and ran a search on [OEIS](https://oeis.org/) which gave me the following sequence [A000469](https://oeis.org/A000469)

The formula to generate these numbers is not very trivial, surprisingly, and the listed Python implementation calls three libraries to generate this sequence. Wouldn't a sieve approach work pretty quickly here? Watch this space.
