This is a meta page describing the design of this website, and instructions to make one of your own. One day, I hope to write a better article arguing why everyone *should* have a personal blog. I assume the reader is sufficiently competent at working with file systems in computers, but may not have much web development experience. Therefore, this could seem basic to more technically competent readers, who are free to clone my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/kyscg/kyscg.github.io) instead.

This blog was built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). This is what is called a static-site generator, which means that the site will have read-only content served by simple html files. This is ideal for a personal website with a blog. I like Jekyll because you can write posts using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/), which is almost like writing plaintext but with some additional improvements. Jekyll then converts the markdown files to html automatically.

It is super simple to create your own site with Jekyll. If you are unfortunate to be on Windows, I would recommend installing Windows Subsystem for Linux and then following the instructions [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/windows/).
