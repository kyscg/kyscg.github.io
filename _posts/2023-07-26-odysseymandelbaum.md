<blockquote>
    <p>Muse, tell me of the man of many wiles,<br>
the man who wandered many paths of exile<br>
after he sacked Troy's sacred citadel.<br>
He saw the cities—mapped the minds—of many;<br>
and on the sea, his spirit suffered every<br>
adversity—to keep his life intact,<br>
to bring his comrades back. In that last task,<br>
he will was firm and fast, and yet he failed:<br>
he could not save his comrades. Fools, they foiled<br>
themselves: they ate the oxen of the Sun,<br>
the herd of Hélios Hypérion;<br>
the lord of light requited their transgression—<br>
he took away the day of their return.<br><br>
Muse, tell us of these matters. Daughter of Zeus,<br>
my starting point is any point you choose.<br>
<br>
All other Greeks who had been spared the steep<br>
descent to death had reached their homes—released<br>
from war and waves. One man alone was left,<br>
still longing for his home, his wife, his rest.<br>
For the commanding nymph, the brightest goddess,<br>
Calypso, held him in her hollow grottoes:<br>
she wanted him as husband. Even when<br>
the wheel of years drew near his destined time—<br>
the time the gods designed for his return<br>
to Ithaca—he still could not depend<br>
upon fair fortune or unfailing friends.<br>
While other gods took pity on him, one—<br>
Poseidon—still pursued: he preyed upon<br>
divine Odysseus until the end,<br>
until the exile found his own dear land. <br>
</p>
