Content on the internet should be permanent, available, and addressable until the original author of the content chooses to remove it. [Automatic Content Selection by Stephen Wolfram](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/06/testifying-at-the-senate-about-a-i-selected-content-on-the-internet/)

- _Even if you don't explicitly know something (say about someone), it can almost always be statistically deduced if there's enough other related data available_
- _Even given every detail of a program, it can be arbitrarily hard to predict what it will or won't do_
- _For a well-optimized computation, there's not likely to be a human-understandable narrative about how it works inside_
- _There's no finite set of principles that can completely define any reasonable, practical system of ethics_  

Stephen Wolfram suggests two options to solve this problem: 1) serve algorithmically ranked content, but allow users to choose the final ranker and 2) allow users to choose constraints on what they want to see, and then use a universal ranker.
