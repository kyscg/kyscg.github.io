There's no stopping Max this season, he's just breezing past everyone. I guess F1 has converged to a point where aero is so overpowered that there wont be any competition if you get it right. This isn't even recent phenomena. It started with Sebastian and then Lewis and now Max. One car, and usually one driver (that's in tune with that car) dominating the field.

Also, I notice that Max loves oversteery cars that are one wrong move away from stepping out on the driver. As long as his car points in the direction that he turns, Max has this Schumacher-esque talent of collecting the back end of the car no matter what it does. This is why the second red bull seat will be a a seat of thorns for anyone who comes in.
