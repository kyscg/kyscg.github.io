- [The Subprime AI Crisis](https://www.wheresyoured.at/subprimeai/): "My concern is that I believe we're in the midst of a subprime AI crisis, where thousands of companies have integrated generative AI at prices that are far from stable, and even further from profitable."  
- [How does Goldene Stack?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11880): when does multilayer Goldene transition into solid gold?  
- [Optimizing Beer Glass Shapes to Minimize Heat Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12043): I really loved reading this paper, so much of it was simply elementary thermodynamics, which was probably why I could understand (and appreciate) it. Fascinating!  
- [The bunkbed conjecture is false](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02545): this is a nice example of a counter-example in graph theory (something that one would think is in the area of pure mathematics) found via neural networks. But this is isn't why it is cool, it just happens to be something that I know about.

- [https://iss-sim.spacex.com/](https://iss-sim.spacex.com/): ISS docking simulator game by SpaceX, this is super cool but insanely hard for me.  
- The Social Radars interview Theranos whistleblower Tyler Schultz: [Part 1](https://pod.link/1677066062/episode/a350809c5169e0a8ab4fc9f2cb086e27) and [Part 2](https://pod.link/1677066062/episode/16f0076c1bc1c949d20751a0182816cd).  
- Elle Luna on [The Great Discontent](https://thegreatdiscontent.com/interview/elle-luna/).  
- [Racing's Deadliest Day](https://www.essesmag.com/articles/racings-deadliest-day), a superb article on the 1955 Le Mans crash.
