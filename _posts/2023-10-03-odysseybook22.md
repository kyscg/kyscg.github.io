> You thought I would never return from Troy;  
> and so - you dogs - you sacked my house, you forced  
> my women servants to your will and wooed  
> my wife in secret while I was alive  
> You had no fear of the undying gods,  
> whose home is spacious Olympus, and no fear  
> of men's revenge, your fate in days to come  
> Now all of you are trapped in death's tight embrace.

The entire book leads up to these lines and when they finally arrive, they are so delicious!!
