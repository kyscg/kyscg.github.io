> But when you're a kid, you don't care about money. You care about a certain feeling. And on that day, this feeling, it was very strong. I felt protected and loved.

> When you lose, it's like you're starving. When you win, it's _still_ like you're starving, but you ate a little crumb.

> When I was 15, I turned to some of my teammates during training. I remember it so clearly. I said to them, “I'll be the best in the world one day.”
> 
> They were kind of laughing about it. I wasn't even on Sporting's first team yet, but I had that belief. I really meant it.

> It is like a final reminder … a final motivation. It says, “_El sueño del niño_.” The dream of the child.
