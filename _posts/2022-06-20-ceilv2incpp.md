title: Nicer ceil function in C++
subtitle: The inbuilt ceil function was being very unwieldy. I prefer defining my own inline function now.

```cpp

int ceil(int numerator, int denominator):
{
    return (numerator + denominator - 1) / denominator;
}

```

and in case of suspected overflow, use this

```cpp

int ceil(int numerator, int denominator)
{
    if (numerator % denominator == 0)
    {
        return numerator / denominator;
    } else
    {
        return numerator / denominator + 1;
    }
}
```
