I came upon this delightfully technical article on the possibilities of a Venus
colony, wait for it, not on the surface of the planet but in the atmosphere of
Venus! around 50 km above the surface. The rationale is that while the surface is
very hostile to human life, the zone 50 km above is the most earth-like in the solar
system. I did not know this, and I wonder how they ascertained that. First
principles wise, space is hard. There's the minor issue of oxygen, but we also need
carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and basically every element that we have evolved to live
in harmony with on earth. Apart from all that, winning the under-appreciation
contest, is gravity. We're going to go all loopy, literally and figuratively, if we
don't have gravity.

Long story short, the surface of Venus sucks. Surface temperature of 737 K (300 K on
earth), surface pressure of 9.2 MPa (0.1 MPa on earth) and an atmosphere with 96.5%
CO$_2$ which, get this, exists in a supercritical state at the surface because of
the pressures. The worst part, there's no sun, because of all the poisonous[^1] cloud
cover[^2].

But 50 km above the surface is quite a different story. Apart from the acidic
clouds (H$_2$SO$_4$), the conditions are very earthlike. Temperatures around 320 K,
pressure of 0.1 MPa, gravity is a little less than what we get on earth but manageable,
and we get some sun. We still cannot breathe though, and heat waves would take out the
entire population if there was no protection. But this is as good as we have it under
the sun. Literally, this is as good as we have it in our solar system.
                                
The proposal is this. We colonize the air of Venus. We build floating cities, much like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vimana"><em>vimanas</em></a> or the golden
floating
city of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripura_(mythology)#The_construction_of_the_three_cities"><em>Tripura</em></a>.
Considerations include breathing (oxygen supply), solar radiation shielding,
anti-corrosive measures in the air, pressure differentials and repairs in case of gas
leaks, length of the solar day (116.8 times that of earth) and resources (both for
maintenance and exploration purposes)

Space is wonderful and it is probably my fear of getting nerd-sniped into eternity
that I don't spend more time on these ideas.

[^1]: Please note that it is not the poison that blocks out the sun, but the clouds themselves. I would not have needed to add this note if someone hadn't asked me if there was something about the poison that did it. No. The clouds are not laced with SPF50++.

[^2]: Fun fact: The reflective power of the clouds above the surface of Venus is so powerful that one can generate the same power by pointing the solar panels down into the reflective clouds as up into the sun.
