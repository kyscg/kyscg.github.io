Recording of [Agi](https://www.youtube.com/@Cintanai) and I trying to beat StockFish Level 8 in a winning endgame. It took us more than two hours to crack it. The position turned out to be far more technical than either of us expected, and the solution required a lot of coordination between all of our pieces. This was also the most exhausting chess analysis I've ever done, and it wasn't even that much. We were at best calculating one variation for a depth of four to five moves. It just shows how good chess masters are (for reference, I would guess my FIDE rating to be around 1300).

FEN of the position:

```
8/4ppkp/1r1p2p1/1P6/8/2N5/6PP/1R4K1 b - - 0 32
```
