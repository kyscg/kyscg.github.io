* The Fibonacci numbers count the number of ways a natural number can be expressed as
the sum of 1s and 2s while
considering the order. What is the average number of 1s and 2s needed to create a
sum equal to any natural number?

* Choose random numbers between 0 and 1, uniformly and independently, until the sum
of
the numbers exceeds 1. What is
the expected number of terms?
* Let $f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ be a continuous function such that for all
real numbers $x$ and $y,$ $$f(x+y)-f(x)-f(y)=xy+x^2y+xy^2$$ and $f(6)=69.$ Find $f(2\sqrt{6})$.
