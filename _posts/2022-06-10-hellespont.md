The Hellespont is the ancient name for the Dardenelles Straits, they separated Europe from Asia. Alexander crossed the Hellespont from Greece and threw his spear into Persian soil, thereby declaring war on the Achaemenid Persian Empire. Personally, I think this act was what defined Alexander. Alexander could have stayed home in Greece, raised a family, been a great king, and died a celebrated man. But this was not him. By crossing the Hellespont and daring to invade Persia, he transcended his mortality. It is a reminder to me that I have a Hellespont to cross.
