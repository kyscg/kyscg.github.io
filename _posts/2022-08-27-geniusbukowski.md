<blockquote>
    <br>
    but there is genius in their hatred<br>
    there is enough genius in their hatred to kill you<br>
    to kill anybody<br>
    not wanting solitude<br>
    not understanding solitude<br>
    they will attempt to destroy anything<br>
    that differs from their own<br>
    not being able to create art<br>
    they will not understand art<br>
    they will consider their failure as creators<br>
    only as a failure of the world<br>
    not being able to love fully<br>
    they will believe your love incomplete<br>
    and then they will hate you<br>
    and their hatred will be perfect<br>
    <br>
    like a shining diamond<br>
    like a knife<br>
    like a mountain<br>
    like a tiger<br>
    like hemlock<br>
    <br>
    their finest art
