                            <p><em>This article is an analytical expose of skill moves. Flashy turns and sudden flicks
                                    look good on the screen, but why
                                    aren't they more popular at the highest level? Is it the mark of a good player to
                                    pull off a gaspy stunt in the middle
                                    of a high-pace game or is it just immature?</em></p>

                            <p><em>In this article, I will attempt to carefully sift through what makes a skill move

                                    will define skill moves, explain what I want out of a player in a game, and in the
                                    end, give you my opinion on what is

                            <p>Consider a defensive transition,<input type="checkbox" id="cb-1" /><label for="cb-1"><sup
                                        id="footnote-1"><span class="node-link">1</span></sup></label><span><br><br>1: A
                                    defensive transition is a phase of play where the team doesn't have possession of
                                    the ball and are looking to recover
                                    it by various means.
                                    <br><br></span> each player of the team is now responsible either for defending a
                                pocket of space
                                (usually behind them) or for marking an opponent. During this transition, if an
                                opposition player were to break away
                                from their defender into space, it will throw the entire setup into disarray.<input
                                    type="checkbox" id="cb-2" /><label for="cb-2"><sup id="footnote-2"><span
                                            class="node-link">2</span></sup></label><span><br><br>2: The basic idea is
                                    that defenders leave their posts to close down the runaway attacker. This opens
                                    spaces for other
                                    attackers and leaves the goal vulnerable.
                                    <br><br></span>
                                Understanding the above scenario is
                                crucial as it will help us understand what we mean by a skill move, and how it is
                                different from other ways of knocking
                                the ball into space by beating defenders.</p>

                            <p>In football, there are two major categories of defenses, zonal marking and man-marking.
                                In zonal marking, the focus is
                                on the team-mates' positions and the ball whereas in man-marking, the focus is on an
                                opponent. To counter these
                                defensive techniques, teams try to do something called as dismarking where they "shake
                                off" the defence, create space,
                                and open up passing lanes towards the goal.</p>

                            <p>We will not focus on team dis-marking tactics in this post, where groups of players work
                                together to get past defences.
                                As such, we will not cover rotations and 3rd man techniques like layoffs, passes, and
                                basic one-twos. What we will focus
                                on are individual efforts at dis-marking, and the different methods (often creative)
                                that players employ to achieve
                                this.</p>

                            <h2 id="section-0"><a href="#section-0">What is a skill move?</a></h2>

                            <p>For the rest of this article, a skill move is the employment of a false or double
                                movement in order to trick the
                                defender into moving one way and exiting in another direction. The definition keeps
                                things simple, and while there are
                                many skills that don't fit into this category, this serves as a good starting point.</p>
                            <p>A false movement is one that makes the defender think that the attacker is moving one way
                                while the attacker has only
                                "faked" the move. A double movement is a fast trick that makes the ball or the player
                                move to a direction while waiting
                                (hoping?) for the defender to commit. After the defender takes the bait, the attacker
                                deftly goes the other way.</p>

                            <h2 id="section-1"><a href="#section-1">Effectiveness vs. flashiness</a></h2>

                            <p>Some tricks are crowd pleasers, some tricks are so mundane that they're not considered
                                skill moves in modern football.
                                If you have applied to an academy or have been to football trials anytime, your chances
                                of selection will not be boosted
                                by your ability to perform tricks with the ball unless you get the basics right. This is
                                true while training for a game
                                too, the coach and the rest of the team are not asking you to show a few trick moves per
                                game and head home.</p>

                            <p>The handshake is unnecessary. There is no need for your skill move to do anything other
                                than beat the defender, and
                                create more attacking options for your team. If you are an up and coming winger trained
                                in the school of street
                                football, you might not like this view, but it is the truth. Effectiveness beats
                                flashiness, but the best of the best
                                make sure that their effective tricks are also worthy of generating a million views on
                                YouTube.</p>

                            <h2 id="section-2"><a href="#section-2">Change in player direction</a></h2>

                            <p>Skill moves that involve a change in player direction are some of the best tricks that we
                                have seen. The shoulder drop,
                                body-feints, receiving a pass while facing the wrong direction to fool the marker,
                                step-overs and many others are
                                examples of skills that use the attacker's body to send the defender the wrong way.
                                While the shoulder-drop and fake
                                shot get more effective as you get closer to goal, the others work almost anywhere else
                                on the field.</p>
                            <p>Good midfielders master this art of deception by learning to receive the ball in an angle
                                that makes it look like they
                                are doing something, while they are actually waiting for the marker to commit and go the
                                other way.<input type="checkbox" id="cb-3" /><label for="cb-3"><sup

                                headache for defenders to counter. Wingers have been employing the stepover to great
                                success since Brazilians like
                                Robinho, Ronaldo and Ronaldinho, but the technique has gained popularity in the last
                                decade and a half thanks to
                                Cristiano Ronaldo<input type="checkbox" id="cb-4" /><label for="cb-4"><sup

                            <h2 id="section-3"><a href="#section-3">Change in ball movements</a></h2>

                            <p>The skills involving sudden ball movements are signatures of technically gifted players.
                                These skills are sure-shot
                                effective when done right but usually lead to loss of possession. Andres Iniesta comes
                                to mind with his deft two-touch
                                and release being one of the most elegant ways to get past a defender. Backheels and
                                chops are some of the most
                                aesthetically pleasing skills to watch out for but they are waning in popularity because
                                of how much speed you need to
                                carry while doing them. Other skills are the elastico, and tricks in the air. Neymar is
                                a player who relies a lot on
                                moving the ball off the ground to get past defenders and while the moves are effective,
                                they don't get a lot of
                                recognition as they're seen as flashy.</p>

                            <h2 id="section-4"><a href="#section-4">How to identify good skill moves</a></h2>

                            <p>Now we don the hat of an analyst, are there skill moves which are better than the other?
                                Are there tricks that are
                                better off not used in a game? Should you teach players to learn certain skills and
                                discard the others?</p>
                            <p>The answer to all the questions above is yes. One good rule of thumb is that simple moves
                                are better, because every
                                second on the ball drains player energy, and you don't want a game where one player has
                                the ball for too long. These
                                stats are glorified, but it is usually the mark of a team close to ruin. All skill moves
                                drastically increase in
                                effectiveness with closeness to goal. The reasons are simple, the stakes are higher, and
                                the pressure cracks the less
                                experienced.</p>

                            <h2 id="section-5"><a href="#section-5">How to defend against a skill move</a></h2>

                            <p>In general, a good defender is the one that slowly squeezes the game out of the attacker.
                                You have to be a player that
                                gives no time for the attacker to think and to get into space. While this requires you
                                to be tireless, you shouldn't
                                just run around the attacker and call yourself an intense defender.</p>
                            <p>Defend either the man or the ball, but do not defend both. Move the attacker into
                                congested areas, get the attacker to
                                shift the ball to their weaker foot and don't lunge for the ball at the first
                                opportunity. The best defenders commit to
                                the tackle as late as they can while "suffocating" the attacker all the time.</p>

                            <h2 id="section-6"><a href="#section-6">Why nothing beats the body feint</a></h2>

                            <p>The body feint follows a simple rule: pretend to do one thing and do something else. If
                                done right, the defender takes
                                the bait and opens up a some space or gives you some more time. Football is littered
                                with feints, the sudden stop of the
                                ball while the defender runs off into the crowd, the offside trap, and many more.</p>
                            <p>The body feint works the best because the defender has spent the entire game <em>building
                                    up
                                    expectations</em>, and the attacker
                                has helped by repeating the false movement to prime the defender. It combines the most
                                effective techniques while
                                managing to look impressive. A research team at Norway even analyzed the effectiveness
                                of body feints.<input type="checkbox" id="cb-5" /><label for="cb-5"><sup

                            <p>The best way to learn skill moves is to try them out on the pitch. A major beginner
                                mistake is to do lots of drills
                                during practice and in their backyard but not implementing them in the game. Failure
                                rate will be high initially, and
                                your teammates will get tired of seeing you lose the ball all the time but that is the
                                cost of getting better.</p>
                            <p>Try out the body feint and the stepover the next time you go out to play and try to
                                understand why you couldn't pull it
                                off. Was your touch too heavy? Did the defender see through your pretense? Were you too
                                slow to react? And watch out for
                                fouls!</p>

                            <h2 id="section-8"><a href="#section-8">Conclusion</a></h2>

                            <p>I have not talked about some very unusual skill moves in this post, for example, the
                                rabona has always been an enigma to
                                me. There is no clear reason why it's useful but in front of goal, when everyone's
                                expecting a shot or a pass from your
                                weak foot, it can help if you can hook the ball into goal. The pirouette is another
                                famous one, which is a combination
                                of a player movement and a ball movement.</p>

                            <p>For all this talk about skills and tricks, the number of skill moves in a game is usually
                                in the single digits. A good
                                activity for the reader is to pick any game from top-flight football and count the
                                number of times a player successfully
                                got away with a trick. The numbers look bad and I guess that the reason is because
                                managers prefer to not get their
                                teams in positions where a single mistake can change the game.</p>

                            <p>Is that a good thing or a bad thing?</p>

                                    defensive transition is a phase of play where the team doesn't have possession of
                                    the ball and are looking to recover
                                    it by various means.

                                <p>2: The basic idea is
                                    that defenders leave their posts to close down the runaway attacker. This opens
                                    spaces for other
                                    attackers and leaves the goal vulnerable.
