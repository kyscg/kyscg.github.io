<p>good book, the whole christian evangelism propaganda was overdone in my opinion, but it is tolerable.</p>

<h3 id="2-south-sea-tales-by-jack-london-3755">2. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/1208/pg1208-images.html">South Sea Tales</a> by Jack London <span style="float: right;"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(3.75/5)</code></span></h3>

<p>Some Robinson Crusoesque short stories that I really enjoyed reading. I liked The House of Mapuhi, Mauki, and The Heathen a lot.</p>

<h3 id="3-the-call-of-the-wild-by-jack-london-55">3. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/215/pg215-images.html">The Call of the Wild</a> by Jack London <span style="float: right;"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(5/5)</code></span></h3>

<p>I love this book so much, for so many reasons. As a child, I used to open this book to the scene where Buck pulls a thousand pounds for John and read it over and over again. Simply wonderful.</p>

<h3 id="4-white-fang-by-jack-london-55">4. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/910/pg910-images.html">White Fang</a> by Jack London <span style="float: right;"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(5/5)</code></span></h3>

<p>my third consecutive Jack London book, I can’t get enough of his writing. I wish I read this when I was in school. For me, this is better than The Call of the Wild as far as the writing and story go. I am going to go around for the next few days asking everyone I run into to read this book.</p>

<h3 id="5-suicide-notes-by-michael-thomas-ford-45">5. <a href="https://www.michaelthomasford.com/ya-novels.html">Suicide Notes</a> by Michael Thomas Ford <span style="float: right;"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(4/5)</code></span></h3>

<p>I hadn’t realised how much I missed this sarcastic percy jacksonesque humour until I started reading this book. I finished this in one sitting, which is something childhood me wouldn’t really think was anything special but many winters have passed since I read a book cover to cover without stopping.</p>

<p>both the dialogue and monologue are great, the plot kinda darkens and pales simultaneously towards the end but it was still very enjoyable to read. also, the subject matter is clearly dark, and the humour does a very good job of being thoughtful as well as effective.</p>

<h3 id="6-night-watch-by-jayne-anne-phillips-35">6. <a href="https://jayneannephillips.com/night-watch/">Night Watch</a> by Jayne Anne Phillips <span style="float: right;"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(3/5)</code></span></h3>

<p>wasn’t too bad, although I felt that narration + dialogue were far stronger than descriptions in many places. I have no clue what that Weed character is doing in the book except as a literary device for more exposition, and even that is a weak justification.</p>

<p>I am updating the review on my website a month after reading it, and one thing that stands out is how certain aspects of the book linger on for a long time. The whole Civil War thing, and rustic descriptions of rural America. Very enduring. I can see why it appealed to the Pulitzer folks.</p>

<h3 id="7-the-financial-lives-of-the-poets-by-jess-walter-45">7. <a href="https://www.jesswalter.com/the_financial_lives_of_the_poets__2009__94357.htm">The Financial Lives of the Poets</a> by Jess Walter <span style="float: right;"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(4/5)</code></span></h3>

<p>this writing has some of the best self-deprecating + existentialist humour ever written. some parts would go real viral on substack/blog-screenshot-twitter. the plot gets weak at some places and the ending is lacklustre. almost like it was written in the hope that it would be adapted into a movie.</p>

<h3 id="8-war-and-peace-by-leo-tolstoy-translated-by-louise-and-aylmer-maude-4755">8. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2600">War and Peace</a> by Leo Tolstoy, translated by Louise and Aylmer Maude <span style="float: right;"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(4.75/5)</code></span></h3>

<p>there is nothing that hasn’t been said before about this, so I wont waste my time. I loved reading the book, it never felt long, or boring, or difficult, or any of the usual excuses people give for not picking it up. The first time I read it, I simply didn’t have any historical background to appreciate it, but now I get why Tolstoy wanted to write this book.</p>

<p>Obviously, he has a very strong anti-Napoleon bias, and that put me off in some sections. But can we really blame the Russians for not liking Napoleon? His ideas on history are coherent until the epilogue, and then they get into youtube video-essay script territory. As far as characters go, Napoleon was my favourite (no surprises there) followed by Prince Andrei. Absolutely despised the entire Kuragin clan, and Anna Pavlovna, and Pierre Bezukhov. While the Kuragin’s and Anna Pavlovna are just despicable people, Pierre is guilty in that he is a comfort-seeking man, the worst of the lot.</p>

<p>docked a quarter star for all the forced Napoleon hate, Vive l’Empereur!</p>

<h3 id="9-a-study-in-scarlet-by-arthur-conan-doyle-255">9. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/244/pg244-images.html">A Study in Scarlet</a> by Arthur Conan Doyle <span style="float: right;"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(2.5/5)</code></span></h3>

<p>what was that in the middle? the most pointless backstory ever. The Sherlock stuff was cool. but that flashback ruined it all.</p>

<h3 id="10-odyssey-by-stephen-fry-45">10. <a href="https://www.stephenfry.com/store/">Odyssey</a> by Stephen Fry <span style="float: right;"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(4/5)</code></span></h3>

<p>I am rather unfairly partial to the Allen Mandelbaum translation of The Odyssey (because it was the first classic I ever read) and so I am not going to say this was a great retelling or anything.</p>

<p>However, I think Fry’s four volumes on Greek Myths are incredibly important for how all-encompassing they are. My first exposure to the Ancient Greek myths and legends was Mandelbaum’s translation of the Odyssey, and then I picked up the Robert Graves book on Greek Myths off a shelf in my school library. After reading that, I was so captivated that I searched far and wide for other such books but never found any.</p>

<p>Children now wont have to search farther than the next book in the series. Athena smiles on Stephen Fry.</p>

<h3 id="11-the-room-on-the-roof-by-ruskin-bond-25">11. <a href="https://www.google.co.in/books/edition/THE_ROOM_ON_THE_ROOF/1MGC-Iu1yPkC">The Room on the Roof</a> by Ruskin Bond <span style="float: right;"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(2/5)</code></span></h3>

<p>quaint and nice, but also drawn-out in some places.</p>

<h3 id="12-1984-by-george-orwell-55">12. <a href="https://www.george-orwell.org/1984">1984</a> by George Orwell <span style="float: right;"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(5/5)</code></span></h3>

<p>This is essential reading. The writing is so powerful, and prescient. One can argue that the idea of the thought police is very far away from most people’s concern, especially in light of the recent resurgence of free-speech absolutists. But I think this book is about Fear, and how it paralyzes and eventually snuffs out everything brilliant and unique about humans. I might read Brave New World sometime soon, that one is about Greed.</p>

<h3 id="13-napoleon-by-andrew-roberts-55">13. <a href="https://www.andrew-roberts.net/books/napoleon-a-life/">Napoleon</a> by Andrew Roberts <span style="float: right;"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(5/5)</code></span></h3>

<p>the last great man in history</p>

<p>Vive l’Empereur!</p>
