                                    </blockquote>This is a minimalist alternative to Goodreads with only books that I
                                    finished reading. I re-read most of my books multiple times, this is only because I
                                    enjoy the book in a different manner with every reading. Ergo, the list might not
                                    have many unique elements. <br><br>

                                    It is very hard to compress a book down to a five-point scale, and these numbers
                                    keep changing as I revisit the books, so I wouldn't put too much store by them. I've
                                    thought of a nice way to mark out the good ones and the bad ones from the rest by
                                    writing their reviews in different colours compared to the rest.

                                        starts stealing just because he can't control himself. Really throws out the
                                        entire "aesthetics are more important than ethics" theme that the author tries
                                        to sell.<br><br>
                                        What I liked about the book was the description of the artworks, and there is

                                        <p>3.75/5<br>Look, when I first heard Goggins came out with an other book, I was
                                        convinced it was a publicity stunt, because how can you replicate Can't Hurt Me?
                                        That book was iconic because it was authentic, will this be authentic? Or will
                                        it be another sub-par sophomore book by a famous personality that hit it big
                                        with their first book. With these doubts, I just wasn't willing to read this
                                        one, but after completing Living with a SEAL, I wanted more Goggins'
                                        stories.<br><br>
                                        This book is just as good as Can't Hurt Me in all the places where Goggins is
                                        narrating episodes from his life. It falls flat in places where he's not
                                        narrating and it's just some advice that feels placed there to complete some
                                        word count. I can never get enough of his stories, never, and for this I rate
                                        the book very well. One-time read for sure.

                                        <p>3/5<br>Super low effort writing, this. Could've been so much more. You do
                                        expect Percy to mature but not into a middle-aged man, which is what he sounds
                                        like in many places. The beloved Percy Jackson sarcasm has mellowed out, and
                                        only shows up a handful of times through the book. The ending is some of the
                                        weakest writing I've read in a long while, the chapter breaks are forced and
                                        pointless, just bad overall. Pains me to rate a Percy Jackson book anything but
                                        five stars.<br><br>

                                        Was this book just promo for the new series? Seems very much like that. The
                                        saving grace is that this is not another Cursed Child.</p>

                                        Some parts of the book were very engaging, the rest were a slog. The writing
                                        lets the book down, did no editor read it before it was published?</p>

                                        <p>4.75/5<br>This book will forever be special to me, it opened my mind to the
                                        kind of stories I never thought were possible to write. Interpreter of Maladies
                                        was my first Jhumpa Lahiri book ever, it was assigned reading to me as part of
                                        an advanced english course in my first undergraduate semester and I couldn't get
                                        enough of it, I think I read the book over and over again until I couldn't
                                        savour the deliciousness of the writing anymore. Oh! How I wish I could read it
                                        again for the first time. It is also the book I gift the most, because everyone
                                        needs to read it :)<br><br>
                                        My favourite stories are <em>Mrs. Sen's</em> (which was my assigned story!) and
                                        <em> A Temporary Matter</em> which is Lahiri at her best.</p>

                                        <p>4.25/5<br>I've always had a soft spot about Jeff Bezos and the Amazon
                                        story.
                                        I
                                        mean, starting an internet book store and turning
                                        it into a global empire worth more than one and a half trillion dollars using
                                        leverage, and the power of technology, is
                                        extraordinary. I bought a physical copy of Amazon Unbound from a local
                                        bookstore, back in 2021, and decided to finally
                                        read it this summer.<br><br>

                                        It's easy to read the book, partly because the story is captivating, but also
                                        because Brad Stone can spin a good yarn.
                                        So many times, I found myself stopping to think about how unreal what Amazon and
                                        Jeff Bezos were doing. Let us give the
                                        S-Team some credit too, so this means that the S-Team, and Jeff were working,
                                        more often than not, simultaneously, on

                                        - COVID-19 <br><br>

                                        While reading about Bezos' idea to sell steak on a truck by going around
                                        neighbourhoods, I realized that so much of
                                        Amazon's seemingly brilliant ideas would never have taken off if they didn't
                                        have the capital. So now, the question is,
                                        if you gave a lot of people (a statistically significant number) a lot of money,
                                        would they reproduce Amazon's results?
                                        Culture matters a lot, but are there other cultures that could achieve similar
                                        or greater levels of success? <br><br>

                                        Amazon opened up their store to sellers from China who flooded their market with
                                        low-quality ripoffs. So the question
                                        is, do you just give everything to the customer and let them make the choice or
                                        do you enforce a quality bar that all
                                        sellers have to cross? And on the next level, what does it mean for sellers that
                                        are making high quality originals if a
                                        Chinese clone will always take away their customer base? <br><br>

                                        Amazon Go and their "Just Walk Out Technology". How do you create the best store
                                        in the world? <br><br>

                                        I don't think Jeff was at his best with Blue Origin, maybe that was one step too
                                        much for the great man, maybe he was
                                        just unlucky. But Blue Origin should have done so much more. <br><br>

                                        What is the future of Amazon now? Can they afford to ignore structural and
                                        organizational inefficiencies and go
                                        innovating again? Or will Jassy have to iron out some kinks first? <br><br>

                                        These were questions I had, I will end with my favourite leadership principle
                                        from Jeff. Principle 8: Think Big.
                                        Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>

                                        stories are
                                        better than the others. The foreword about
                                        typewriters is some nice writing, so are the chapters with Anna, MDash, and
                                        Steve Wong. The rest aren't that great.</p>

                                        <p>2.5/5<br>I can't believe I never read all those Agatha Christie books lying
                                        around in my library. I actually enjoyed her writing, even though I skimmed
                                        through much of the book to find out what I'd been suspecting halfway through
                                        the book. I initially gave it 3.5 stars but now that I think of it, 3.5 stars is
                                        way too generous for this book, considering that finding out who the killer is
                                        didn't need all the other revelations made in the book about all the characters.
                                        That was just used to add some spice and suspicion, and not actually used in the
                                        final analysis. Emily Trefusis is a brilliantly written character, very well
                                        done.</p>

                                        <p>5/5<br>I will never rate this series anything less than a complete 5 out of
                                        5. Nothing has come close, and will anything ever
                                        come close? This time around, I listened to the audiobook versions of all the
                                        books except for the Deathly Hallows for
                                        which I just wasn't patient enough to listen to the audiobook, and had to open
                                        my physical copy. Stephen Fry does very
                                        well, and I only realized after listening to him do the various accents of the
                                        UK about why Hagrid, Tonks, and Seamus'
                                        dialogues were written that way. The last time I read the books, I was too
                                        young, and wasn't aware of all the accents.
                                        So that was a new experience for me. The Jim Dale audiobooks are just as good,
                                        but I don't know why he made Bellatrix
                                        sound slightly Eastern European.</p>

                                        <p>4.25/5<br>When you read a book of this magnitude, you always have a moment
                                        when something profound strikes you. For me, it was
                                        when I was nearing the midpoint of the book, and I read that John D. had
                                        retired, or more like, gave away most duties to
                                        Archbold. So that meant that more than half of the book was dedicated to his
                                        life after Standard Oil. I wasn't expecting
                                        this, but now that I've finished reading the book, I realize how much more
                                        should have been there.<br><br>

                                        Titan, derived from the Greek $\text{Τιτάν}$, originally referring to the
                                        offspring of the sky and the earth, they were
                                        larger than life, primordial to the gods, all-encompassing, all-powerful beings.
                                        You tend to lose sight of Rockefeller's
                                        status as you read episode after episode of him conducting history-making
                                        events. A few times in the book, when Chernow
                                        addresses him as the Titan, you pause to think about it and it hits you.<br><br>

                                        John D. Rockefeller evokes so many conflicting emotions in you, you alternate
                                        from admiration, to perplexion, to alarm,
                                        to wonder, and then back to admiration. I'm not sure you can tell what drove
                                        him, he made money for the sole purpose of
                                        making money, and then gave it away with pinpoint precision, aimed at the best
                                        causes of his times. He was adamant about
                                        his name not going on anything he gave to, which led to me being surprised
                                        throughout the book that he was the cause for so
                                        many great institutions to rise. He evades, very much to my frustration, all
                                        attempts to stereotype him. He makes it
                                        even harder by being evasive and secretive on purpose. He worked with feverish
                                        devotion, and made every move after being
                                        frustratingly slow and careful, his schedule was rigid, he had no impulses, and
                                        was obsessively pedantic about his
                                        money. On the other hand, he retired very young, and spent the rest of his life
                                        with youthful energy with his family in
                                        the estates he built.<br><br>

                                        There were so many big names sprinkled throughout his life, I did not know that
                                        he founded the University of Chicago, or
                                        that he was the first to start funding large scale medical research (the vaccine
                                        against hookworm, and malaria treatment
                                        research). Names like Helen Keller, who was partially given financial assistance
                                        by Rockefeller, Ida Tarbell who was
                                        Rockefeller's kryptonite and successfully brought to light the unsavory aspects
                                        of his rise to the top, Mark Twain, I
                                        learnt that the MoMA was founded by Abby Aldrich Rockefeller, wife of Junior,
                                        Carl Jung who treated his daughter Edith
                                        in Europe, and then got funded by Rockefeller money, Frederick T. Gates who
                                        helped Rockefeller invest and give away his
                                        money wisely and Teddy Roosevelt, who was a master politician, and always seemed
                                        to get away with double-crossing
                                        Standard Oil.<br><br>

                                        Chernow writes this biography with all the colour of a novel, he takes care to
                                        psychologically delve into Rockefeller's
                                        early days, that leaves us wanting more. However, I wasn't too fond of all the
                                        discussion about Rockefeller's minor
                                        satellites, like his work with the Baptist church, or Junior's life and heirs.
                                        While they were an important part of his
                                        life, I wanted more of John D. than the others. There's also an unnecessary
                                        theme running throughout the book that
                                        Rockefeller was not as bad as Tarbell made him out to be, which felt too much
                                        like, "the lad doth protest too much".<br><br>

                                        This makes me want to read The Power Broker by Robert Caro, which is supposed to
                                        be a better piece of writing. Watch this space!!

                                        <p>3/5<br>Allen has a line about computer programming being a meritocracy and
                                        how anyone could write programs regardless of background. And then, a few pages
                                        later, he writes about how he racked up hundreds of dollars in compute time, and
                                        his dad just paid for them. Myopic.<br><br>

                                        This venture was super interesting, considering how my first academic
                                        research was along these lines. <a

                                        The book is excellent; I loved all the parts about Bill and his unrelenting
                                        leadership style. Definitely would have
                                        loved to read more about Bill. Paul Allen is super-cool, too. With his
                                        Renaissance man style of living, he probably
                                        squeezed more from the lemon than Bill Gates did. The best part is Paul Allen's
                                        prescience, it is uncanny, and you start
                                        to wonder if his predictions were as trivial to make as he makes them sound. The
                                        appendix lists ideas in Artificial
                                        Intelligence that Allen describes, and many have been solved in the last couple
                                        of years. RIP, Paul Allen; you literally
                                        would have loved 2023.</p>

                                        first aware of the effects of the twin bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki from a
                                        Vikram Seth poem almost a decade
                                        ago. "A Doctor's Journal Entry for August 6, 1945," writes about the plight of
                                        the citizens of Hiroshima immediately
                                        after Little Man exploded in the air above their unassuming daily lives. We were
                                        made to watch a documentary about the
                                        bombing in school. We had to write essays about the inhumanity of the bombing
                                        for credit.<br><br>
                                        A couple of years later, I was introduced to Richard Feynman via his
                                        undergraduate level Physics lectures. He talks
                                        about his time in Los Alamos in his autobiography. I was reintroduced to the
                                        atomic bomb purely from a scientific
                                        perspective. The burning and mass murder of an entire city was unimportant in
                                        the face of an atom's profound power
                                        within its nucleus. And why shouldn't it be? We had come far from the days of
                                        Democritus and Aristotle. From Newton to
                                        Dalton to Avogadro, all of whom set the atom and the molecule firmly in stone.
                                        The electron came to life as a cathode
                                        ray when Thomson applied a voltage across two electrodes in a vacuum. Rutherford
                                        mentioned an idea for an experiment to
                                        Marsden and Geiger, resulting in the famous gold-leaf experiment that showed us
                                        the nucleus. Niels Bohr used ideas from
                                        Max Plank and Einstein to show how the electrons wouldn't collapse into the
                                        nucleus, Rutherford split nitrogen to
                                        produce protons, and Chadwick discovered the neutron. And finally, rounding off
                                        everything, de Broglie, Schrödinger, and
                                        Heisenberg described the complete atom with electron positions as pure
                                        probabilities. The atom was whole. All that
                                        remained was the task of splitting it.<br><br>
                                        When you read Feynman's accounts of his time at Los Alamos, you have this
                                        impression that he was the main character and
                                        that life at Los Alamos revolved around him (or maybe I was too taken by the
                                        great man to not see the bigger picture).
                                        So it was surprising to me that he's only mentioned thrice in the entire book
                                        and only one of those times he's described
                                        as doing anything (setting up the radio before the Trinity test). The giants
                                        that split the atom were no less impressive
                                        than the ones mentioned above. It all started with Henri Becquerel, Marie Curie,
                                        Pierre Curie and Rutherford realizing
                                        that some nuclei undergo radioactive decay. The energetic Fermi bombarded
                                        Uranium with neutrons, leading to Otto Hahn
                                        and Lisa Meitner producing Barium from Uranium, which caused Meitner's nephew
                                        Frisch to call the process "nuclear
                                        fission". Enter Leó Szilárd, who realized that a chain reaction would be
                                        possible. After this final hurdle of
                                        theoretical understanding was crossed, Szilárd, Teller, and Wigner took
                                        Einstein's endorsement and sent the famous
                                        letter to Roosevelt. The juggernaut was set into motion, with enigmatic Robert
                                        Oppenheimer leading it. Man would learn
                                        to harness a tiny bit of the force of nature, and the world would never be the
                                        same again.<br><br>
                                        The writing has the rigour of profound scientific exposition and a thriller
                                        novel's pace. I wish I could write like
                                        this. Just for the writing, I'd recommend reading the book. The chapter on the
                                        bombing is very traumatic to read. I was
                                        finally reminded, after all these years, about what I read in Vikram Seth's poem
                                        about people walking around like
                                        ghosts, their skin hanging off their flesh. Whether or not the US should have
                                        dropped the bombs can be argued. I have a
                                        controversial take on this, which could border on victim-blaming, that Hirohito
                                        should have surrendered earlier. And why
                                        couldn't the US have starved Japan via a naval blockade? Was this a case of
                                        "Rome conquered the world in self-defence"?<br><br>
                                        The foreword to the latest edition is very insightful; Rhodes asks, "Why seventy
                                        thousand nuclear weapons between us
                                        when only a few were more than enough to destroy each other?" One of the great
                                        books, in league with all the big ones
                                        like <em>The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</em> and <em>War and
                                            Peace</em>. I
                                        thoroughly enjoyed reading it, being a
                                        scientist myself and having looked up to all the superstars that come together
                                        in this book. One last comment I'd like
                                        to make is about how fast the Manhattan Project moved; if only we could move at
                                        that pace for everything we do.

                                        It is going to be tough for me to review this book. How do you separate the
                                        review of the biography from the review of
                                        the person? And a person as mercurial, as contemporary, as important as Musk.
                                        Elon Musk is not Isaacson's best work, it
                                        reads like it was written in a hurry. More importantly, it reads like it was
                                        written for Musk, a literary self-portrait
                                        of sorts, where Isaacson feels the need to defend every Musk overture. Having
                                        said that, it is a great biography, and
                                        I've heard that it complements Ashlee Vance's biography and Eric Berger's
                                        LiftOff. <br><br>
                                        Musk is well and truly alive, and Isaacson spent a lot of time with him around
                                        the 2022-23 Twitter acquisition saga.
                                        Both these things mean that there is a lot more focus on the recent past, and
                                        that is where the book is the strongest. I
                                        suspect that the reason for this is we still don't know what actions and
                                        decisions are important in the grand scheme of
                                        things. On the bright side, we get to see how someone like Musk functions every
                                        day. Spoiler: it's right on the edge of
                                        every bell curve possible. <br><br>
                                        If Musk wanted to reclaim some public support, he got it done in the sense that
                                        the book reminds readers that Musk is
                                        human. That is in a way both redeeming and damning. His impulsive behaviour is
                                        very human, and frankly, very normal. His
                                        penchant for silly humour, his mood swings, his childlike ambition, flashes of
                                        anger, unfiltered enthusiasm for the
                                        future, are all very normal. Who among us is a monk? But on the other hand, his
                                        tendencies to exhibit his worst sides so
                                        publicly and so loudly go against his self-purported vision for humanity. He's
                                        wasting energy and proving that absolute
                                        power corrupts absolutely. If he wants to do great things, should he just not
                                        focus on doing great things and nothing
                                        else? <br><br>
                                        It would be myopic of me to perform a character assessment from a biography, so
                                        I shall stop. The book gives a deep
                                        inner look into Musk's personality. The episodes about the treatment from his
                                        father are traumatic to read. Everything
                                        good about Musk arises from his love of building great things, everything bad
                                        about him is his father. A perfect
                                        internalization of the worst flaws of his father, only redeemed by the bright
                                        light that is the thirst for knowledge.
                                        Isaacson keeps this theme alive all through the book, is it not possible to push
                                        your troops without also putting them
                                        down everytime you enter "demon-mode". Leaders should not confuse ruthlessness
                                        in execution with ruthlessness towards
                                        their teams. <br><br>
                                        This leads us to the people this affects, the ones around Musk. Unsurprisingly,
                                        most quoted in the book have at best,
                                        fanatical grovelling and at worst, grudging admiration for the man. This is not
                                        a critique as much as it screams, "the
                                        lad doth protest too much". Musk doesn't seem to have anyone that is capable of
                                        inflicting withering feedback onto him,
                                        again, a common trope among people that wield absolute power. It is my theory
                                        that powerful personalities tend to
                                        alienate well-wishers because everytime they ignore advice and it works out,
                                        they reinforce their belief in their
                                        invincibility. The momentum of victory is a drug. <br><br>
                                        When I read a few other reviews of this book, it was mostly people complaining
                                        about how Isaacson didn't spend 300 odd
                                        pages of the book discussing emerald mines or some variation of the sentiment.
                                        Public sentiment around Musk has never
                                        been more polarized and that might make us look at Musk as this recent pop
                                        culture phenomenon. But Musk is first and
                                        foremost an engineer, and that is the strength of this book. His calls to cut
                                        everything unnecessary, and fixate on
                                        speed is inspirational. All those anecdotes of him getting rid of unnecessary
                                        parts, or shaving of extra seconds in a
                                        factory, or condensing problems to their first principles, or finding the right
                                        metrics to measure progress are very
                                        useful to everyone. So many times when employees are outraged by some
                                        suggestion, it's rarely because the suggestion is
                                        outlandish, and more because they don't like how certain Musk is about his
                                        suggestion. <br><br>
                                        Musk is important because space exploration is important, because we need
                                        electric cars, we want to achieve full
                                        self-driving, and more. But Musk is wrong if he think we'll get there with
                                        flashes of seriousness sprinkled in a bed of
                                        largely irresponsible and impulsive behaviour.

                                        <p>3.0/5<br>It must have been hard to write this book, there are so few accounts
                                        of Mithradates that a lot of the book is a
                                        retelling of all the myths that surround him. It's not like the author doesn't
                                        acknowledge this, but it is more proof
                                        that this must have been a very hard book to write. I enjoyed it a lot, but
                                        there were definitely sections that were
                                        obviously filler and boring to go through. There is also some fanfic in the end.

                                        <p>4.25/5<br>I picked up this book to fill in my gaps of Roman History apart
                                        from the major events. I was fairly well-versed with the
                                        time of Julius Caesar until the time of his funeral. And with the Punic Wars.
                                        But everything before the Punic Wars,
                                        about the founding of Rome, to the seven kings, and the structuring of the
                                        senate and society, was all unknown. I also
                                        didn't know about the Macedonian Wars that were taking place around the time of
                                        the Punic Wars, and how Rome had
                                        provinces in Gaul, Spain, and the East (Illyria and Greece). The era of Marius
                                        and Sulla, the threat of Mithradates, the
                                        last of the strong personalities like Cato the Younger, Pompey, Cicero, Clodius,
                                        Mark Antony.

                                        I listened to this along with Mike Duncan's other book, The Storm Before the
                                        Storm and now I have most of my questions
                                        answered. I think I will pick up with Augustus, move all the way to Nero, and
                                        stop there, because that's much more than
                                        I am interested in at the moment. There are way too many names for me to go on
                                        until the fall of the Western Roman
                                        Empire, much less the Byzantine.

                                        <p>4.25/5<br>Like Robinson Crusoe but in the 21st century and on Mars. The exact
                                        same archetype, so many parallels. It only deviates
                                        in the presence of a third person narrative, the presence of earth's point
                                        of view et cetera. Great book, I think the
                                        popularity of the book is testament to how attractive our human tendency to
                                        survive against all odds is.

                                        Also, what a good scifi book. Instead of having an unrealistic scenario
                                        where the science is made up, this book has a
                                        very realistic setting and shows us how the only things that limit us are
                                        the laws of physics. If we can bring
                                        everything down to that, we can fix a lot of problems. I wonder if any other
                                        scifi book will get this close to being so
                                        technically sound and dense. Watney's character is great, with a lot of
                                        life, very Percy Jackson coded.</p>

                                        was listening to it. Listening to non-fiction is not
                                        always easy, because most of them are very dense, and you need to keep track of

                                        physical copy to turn back the pages. Not this one, this was a masterclass in

                                        <p>3.25/5<br>I have nothing to say about this book that has not been already
                                        said, nor can I say it any better. I like Kafka's
                                        descriptive style, something I always struggle with while writing.<br><br>

                                        One thing I strongly felt was that Samsa and his family should have tried to
                                        develop a system of communication with each
                                        other. The story might have been very different had his family known he
                                        understood them. This is no doubt inspired by my
                                        recent reading of The Martian, so take this opinion with a grain of salt</p>

                                        endearing. For some reason, in my head, I vaguely remember
                                        The Overcoat as a story of a man's coat slowly getting worn out until it just
                                        ceases to exist anymore. Something like
                                        the Ship of Theseus. I don't know if that's another story or if my mind is

                                        <p>3.75/5<br>brilliant writing! brilliant story! I held off on reading this
                                        almost a decade ago because King was associated with
                                        horror, but this book is more a thriller-comedy than a horror story. Maybe I can
                                        slowly tiptoe into King's other works
                                        now?<br><br>

                                        one of my favourite parts about this book is how all of Trisha's phrases and
                                        euphemisms to herself are borrowed from the
                                        people around her.<br><br>

                                        <p>4/5<br>The parts about running are written better than the memoir parts, but
                                        both are still written very well. The running
                                        stuff is more interesting to learn about. I think running is such an interesting
                                        activity because the only reason to
                                        keep going after you're completely worn out is to prove something to yourself. I
                                        liked the parts where he talks about
                                        this choice you face every time you run. It feels Sisyphean.<br><br>

                                        Every run transforms you, and you learn something about your body and mind that
                                        you didn't know before. I feel this is
                                        very true for a lot of sport where you push yourself to get better and better
                                        with time. The satisfied player sticks to
                                        what they do well, the unsatisfied player is never happy with anything they do.
                                        Runners are, by definition, unsatisfied.<br><br>

                                        This is the first time I've read the articulation of the amount of physical
                                        effort it takes to sit and write. Sometimes,
                                        writing is the most draining work I do, a few hours wipe me out for the entire
                                        day. I'm also adding the run from Athens
                                        to Marathon to my bucket list.<br><br>

                                        <p>5/5 (2x read!!)<br>What a book, I would say this takes the top spot for the
                                        year along
                                        with Complications. Maybe this slightly edges
                                        Complications in novelty, but maybe not in importance. This is the kind of book
                                        one should read very quickly first, and
                                        then very slowly a second time, taking in every single sight, smell, taste and
                                        touch. Russia remains the greatest
                                        literary muse!<br><br>

                                        One of my favourite quips of the Count is the wisdom from his father about the
                                        twice-tolling clock. The first toll is to
                                        indicate that one's day of honest work is done, and the second toll is an
                                        admonishment about why one is still awake at
                                        that hour. Nina Kulikova has to be the most arresting character, her spectre
                                        looms so large over the entire story. The
                                        unlabelling of the wine bottles was a very clever metaphor about the times and
                                        their signs. So was Mishka's proclamation
                                        about the Burning of Moscow to inconvenience Napoleon. Seven stars.</p>

                                        <p>5/5<br>One of the greatest literary works ever written. I read this book
                                        first in the Monsoon of 2016 and I remember not being
                                        impressed by the monologues and the stories of characters peripheral to
                                        Raskolnikov. And that is why one re-reads books
                                        of this stature, to realize how much one has grown.<br><br>

                                        I hope to write a longer essay about this book someday but for now, I'll just
                                        list the themes that stood out to me while
                                        I was reading the book. I read the Constance Garnett translation for now but the
                                        Michael Katz translation is something I
                                        want to read before everything else.<br><br>

                                        - The psyche of Raskolnikov (murderer, extraordinary man, depression, kindness)
                                        (the psychological effects of the crime)
                                        (all four of Raskolnikov's nightmares)<br>
                                        - Marmeladov's speech in the tavern to Raskolnikov (<em>"why should I be
                                            pitied?"</em>)<br>
                                        - Raskolnikov's reluctance to accept help from everyone apart from Sonya<br>
                                        - Raskolnikov & Porfiry Petrovich (the legal system, the debate about his essay,
                                        Porfiry as a father figure to Raskolnikov)<br>
                                        - Raskolnikov & Svidrigailov (extraordinary men, immorality vs. amorality)<br>
                                        - Raskolnikov & Sonya (the theist and the atheist, both hopeless, and their
                                        attempts to understand) (Sonya as cathartic
                                        agent to Raskolnikov's suffering)<br>
                                        - Crime and Punishment as a commentary on Russian society at the time (this is
                                        probably beyond my scope and ability)<br>
                                        - Crime and Punishment as a book about matricide.</p>

                                        myths. I listened to the audiobook, and that only enhances the
                                        experience.<br><br>

                                        The story of Troy remains peerless in it's ability to capture my imagination, so
                                        I am biased, but this is a great book.</p>

                                        listened to the audiobook so it was almost like reading
                                        it for the first time, and boy, I have no regrets. Such good writing, I wonder
                                        who the ghostwriter is. Funny,
                                        inspiration, instructive (about apartheid and post-apartheid South Africa), and
                                        emotional. The audiobook takes all of
                                        this to another dimension, Noah's accents and voices are too good.

                                        narrative and descriptive storytelling although just
                                        from this work, it feels like narration is Marquez' stronger suit.

                                        Rating Sapiens has so much to do with what kind of book you think it is. If you
                                        are expecting a rigorous academic treatment of all of world history, you will be
                                        disappointed at best and alarmed at worst. But Harari is aiming for something
                                        other than a precise blow-by-blow of world history. He is writing for people who
                                        took a newfound interest in history and are asking questions like, &quot;How did
                                        we get from caveman to here?&quot; I want to be slightly abrasive and say he
                                        writes for people looking to pick up a few opinions to throw around at the next
                                        dinner conversation. And within that framework, he does a good job.
                                        Almost.<br><br>

                                        Popular science, and in this case, popular history, will always simplify and
                                        overlook a few or more finer details. It is challenging to make academic
                                        research available to the layperson. Therefore, asking questions like, &quot;How
                                        accurate is Sapiens?&quot; is not a good way of rating the book. This is a
                                        paradox because how is a premise supposed to hold up if the evidence supporting
                                        it is inaccurate? But while reading pop history, we shrug our shoulders and
                                        agree to accept a few errors as long as the basic idea gets through.<br><br>

                                        The problem with Harari is that he takes this over-simplification to another
                                        level and distorts well-known history to fit his overall structure. His ideas
                                        about evolution (that it created a &quot;struggle for dominance&quot;) and his
                                        complete erasure of human states that didn&#39;t need ideas like writing or the
                                        &quot;cognitive revolution&quot; is frankly unnecessary. The point could&#39;ve
                                        been made without these inaccuracies, which begs why he needed to explicitly
                                        make these mistakes. The entire chapter about Science, the Industrial
                                        Revolution, and Colonialism is excellent if you want to write a history of
                                        <em>H. Sapiens</em> in Western Europe. Harari mentions other countries&#39;
                                        inventions but waves them away as not natural science because they don&#39;t fit
                                        with his chapter names like &quot;The Animal That Became a God.&quot; Whether
                                        you want to give him the benefit of the doubt here is a personal choice, but
                                        like before, sweeping all this under the rug was unnecessary.<br><br>

                                        It gets comical when you get to the blatant inaccuracies. Harari has just a
                                        single line in the entire book about the French Revolution, that is, drum roll,
                                        plain wrong. There is an excellent comment on r/AskHistorians taking it apart.
                                        Beyond that, Harari&#39;s own thesis advisor in a New Yorker profile admits that
                                        his student dodged fact-checking &quot;by saying, &#39;Let&#39;s ask questions
                                        so large that no one can say, We think this bit&#39;s wrong, and that bit&#39;s
                                        wrong.&#39;&quot;. My personal favourite was in a Current Affairs article where
                                        a biologist points out a line in the book about chimpanzees, that they
                                        <em>&quot;hunt together and fight shoulder to shoulder against baboons, cheetahs
                                            and enemy chimpanzees&quot;</em> and then goes on to say how that&#39;s just
                                        not possible because cheetahs and chimps don&#39;t even live in the same parts
                                        of Africa. When you can&#39;t trust him to get even the small innocent details
                                        right, how could you take him seriously on the big heavy ideas he casually
                                        throws around?<br><br>

                                        Sapiens was the first non-fiction book I read that wasn&#39;t an autobiography,
                                        and I loved it immediately. It made me feel smart. It made me feel like I
                                        understood the world more subtly. Everything was a construct, <em>money,
                                            nation-states, religion, language, writing, capitalism.</em> It gave me more
                                        things to opine about than the other person. I tried to re-read it a few years
                                        after that. I just couldn&#39;t stand all the posturing and unnecessary
                                        oversimplification of historical ideas that didn&#39;t need his cosmetics. They
                                        were perfectly wonderful on their own, and Sapiens just ruined them.
