- Patients with amnesia or agnosia usually answered questions by cues rather than memory, a sort of inference. For example, identifying the month by looking out the window and identifying platonic solids by feeling them.
    - Is the loss in these pattern making abilities greater nowadays than before?
    - What can we recognize nowadays by cues? shapes, yes, I imagine. Seasons, maybe not? More auditory cues than haptic cues?
