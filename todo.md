- Some cool problems from LessWrong about [matrix completion](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pJrebDRBj9gfBE8qE/prizes-for-matrix-completion-problems)
- There's no stopping Max this season, he's just breezing past everyone. I guess F1 has converged to a point where aero is so overpowered that there wont be any competition if you get it right. This isn't even recent phenomena. It started with Sebastian and then Lewis and now Max. One car, and usually one driver (that's in tune with that car) dominating the field.
- Everyone I know that has bought The Cursed Child has the hardback edition (as opposed to the paperback that is released much later). All of us really hoped great things from that book eh?
- I just don’t understand the use of over-rated as critique.
    - Isn’t it enough that we say we don’t like it? Why is it a problem if many others like it?
- Allen Mandelbaum's translation of The Odyssey.

> Muse, tell me of the man of many wiles,\
> the man who wandered many paths of exile\
> after he sacked Troy’s sacred citadel.\
> He saw the cities—mapped the minds—of many;\
> and on the sea, his spirit suffered every\
> adversity—to keep his life intact,\
> to bring his comrades back.  In that last task,\
> he will was firm and fast, and yet he failed:\
> he could not save his comrades.  Fools, they foiled\
> themselves: they ate the oxen of the Sun,\
> the herd of Hélios Hypérion;\
> the lord of light requited their transgression—\
> he took away the day of their return.\
> \
> Muse, tell us of these matters. Daughter of Zeus,\
> my starting point is any point you choose.\
> \
> All other Greeks who had been spared the steep\
> descent to death had reached their homes—released\
> from war and waves.  One man alone was left,\
> still longing for his home, his wife, his rest.\
> For the commanding nymph, the brightest goddess,\
> Calypso, held him in her hollow grottoes:\
> she wanted him as husband.  Even when\
> the wheel of years drew near his destined time—\
> the time the gods designed for his return\
> to Ithaca—he still could not depend \
> upon fair fortune or unfailing friends.\
> While other gods took pity on him, one—\
> Poseidon—still pursued: he preyed upon\
> divine Odysseus until the end,\
> until the exile found his own dear land.

    - Freedom of expression isn’t the tool of the powerful; it’s the tool of the powerless.
    - Malcolm Gladwell pointed out the absurdity of her position by tweeting, “I signed the Harpers letter because there were lots of people who also signed the Harpers letter whose views I disagreed with. I thought that was the point of the Harpers letter.”
    - Whenever a society collapses in on itself, free speech is the first thing to go. That’s how you know we’re in the process of closing up shop. Our legal protections remain in place—that’s why so many of us were able to smack the Trump piñata to such effect—but the culture of free speech is eroding every day. Ask an Oberlin student—fresh outta Shaker Heights, coming in hot, with a heart as big as all outdoors and a 3 in AP Bio—to tell you what speech is acceptable, and she’ll tell you that it’s speech that doesn’t hurt the feelings of anyone belonging to a protected class.

- Patients with amnesia or agnosia usually answered questions by cues rather than memory, a sort of inference. For example, identifying the month by looking out the window and identifying platonic solids by feeling them.
    - Is the loss in these pattern making abilities greater nowadays than before?
    - What can we recognize nowadays by cues? shapes, yes, I imagine. Seasons, maybe not? More auditory cues than haptic cues?

- Nietzsche's "Morality is Cowardice": If you don't have the courage to commit a crime, it doesn't mean you're moral for not committing a crime. It just means you're afraid of doing it. We can see this in mob violence, people riot because they don't think they'll get caught.
