                                <p>“See that little stream - we could walk to it in two minutes. It took the British a
                                    month to walk to it - a whole
                                    empire walking very slowly, dying in front and pushing forward behind. And another
                                    empire walked very slowly
                                    backward a few inches a day, leaving the dead like a million bloody rugs. No
                                    Europeans will ever do that again
                                    in this generation.”</p>
                                <p>“Why, they’ve only just quit over in Turkey,” said Abe. “And in Morocco-”</p>
                                <p>“That’s different. This western-front business couldn’t be done again, not for a long
                                    time. The young men think
                                    they could do it but they couldn’t. They could fight the first Marne again but not
                                    this. This took religion and
                                    years of plenty and tremendous sureties and the exact relation that existed between
                                    the classes. The Russians
                                    and Italians weren’t any good on this front. You had to have a whole-souled
                                    sentimental equipment going back
                                    further than you could remember. You had to remember Christmas, and postcards of the
                                    Crown Prince and his
                                    fiancée, and little cafés in Valence and beer gardens in Unter den Linden and
                                    weddings at the mairie, and going
                                    to the Derby, and your grandfather’s whiskers.”</p>
                                <p>“General Grant invented this kind of battle at Petersburg in sixty-five.”</p>
                                <p>“No, he didn’t - he just invented mass butchery. This kind of battle was invented by
                                    Lewis Carroll and Jules
                                    Verne and whoever wrote Undine, and country deacons bowling and marraines in
                                    Marseilles and girls seduced in the
                                    back lanes of Wurtemburg and Westphalia. Why, this was a love battle - there was a
                                    century of middle-class love
                                    spent here. This was the last love battle.”</p>

                            <blockquote>
                                <p>The entrance of the German army into Brussels has lost the human quality. It was lost
                                    as soon as the three soldiers
                                    who led the army bicycled into the Boulevard du Régent and asked the way to the Gare
                                    du Nord. When they passed, the
                                    human note passed with them. What came after them, and 24 hours later is still
                                    coming, is not men marching, but a
                                    force of nature like a tidal wave, an avalanche or a river flooding its banks. At
                                    this minute it is rolling through
                                    Brussels as the swollen waters of the Conemaugh Valley swept through Johnstown.</p>
                                <p>At the sight of the first few regiments of the enemy we were thrilled with interest.
                                    After they had passed for three
                                    hours in one unbroken steel-grey column we were bored. But when hour after hour
                                    passed and there was no halt, no
                                    breathing time, no open spaces in the ranks, the thing became uncanny, inhuman. You
                                    returned to watch it,
                                    fascinated. It held the mystery and menace of fog rolling toward you across the sea.
                                </p>
                                <p>The grey of the uniforms worn by both officers and men helped this air of mystery.
                                    Only the sharpest eye could detect
                                    among the thousands that passed the slightest difference. All moved under a cloak of
                                    invisibility. Only after the
                                    most numerous and severe tests, with all materials and combinations of colour that
                                    give forth no colour, could this
                                    grey have been discovered. That it was selected to clothe and disguise the German
                                    when he fights is typical of the
                                    German Staff in striving for efficiency to leave nothing to chance, to neglect no
                                    detail.</p>
                                <p>After you have seen this service uniform under conditions entirely opposite you are
                                    convinced that for the German
                                    soldier it is his strongest weapon. Even the most expert marksman cannot hit the
                                    target unless he can see. It is a
                                    grey-green, not the blue-grey of our Confederates. It is the grey of the hour just
                                    before daybreak, the grey of
                                    unpolished steel, of mist among green trees...</p>
                                <p>This army has been on active service three weeks, and so far there is not apparently
                                    a chin-strap or a horseshoe
                                    missing. It came in with the smoke pouring from cookstoves on wheels, and in an hour
                                    had set up post office wagons,
                                    from which mounted messengers galloped along the line of column distributing letters
                                    and at which soldiers posted
                                    picture postcards.</p>
                                <p>The infantry came in files of five, 200 men to each company; the lancers in columns
                                    of four, with not a pennant
                                    missing. The quick-firing guns and field pieces were one hour at a time in passing,
                                    each gun with its caisson and
                                    ammunition wagon taking 20 seconds in which to pass.</p>
                                <p>The men of the infantry sang “Fatherland, My Fatherland”. Between each line of song
                                    they took three steps. At times
                                    2,000 men were singing together in absolute rhythm and beat. When the melody gave
                                    way, the silence was broken only
                                    by the stamp of ironshod boots, and then again the song rose. When the singing
                                    ceased, the bands played marches.
                                    They were followed by the rumbles of siege guns, the creaking of wheels and of
                                    chains clanking against the
                                    cobble-stones and the sharp bell-like voices of the bugles.</p>
                                <p>For seven hours the army passed in such solid column that not once might a taxi-cab
                                    or trolley car pass through the
                                    city. Like a river of steel it flowed, grey and ghostlike. Then, as dusk came and a
                                    thousands of horses’ hoofs and
                                    thousands of iron boots continued to tramp forward, they struck tiny sparks from the
                                    stones, but the horses and men
                                    who beat out the sparks were invisible.</p>
                                <p>At midnight, pack wagons and siege guns were still passing. At seven this morning I
                                    was awakened by the tramp of men
                                    and bands playing jauntily. Whether they marched all day or not I do not know; but
                                    for 26 hours the grey army
                                    rumbled with the mystery of fog and the pertinacity of a steamroller.</p>
