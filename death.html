                                    fact? This course will
                                    examine a number of issues that arise once we begin to reflect on our mortality. The
                                    possibility that death may
                                    not actually be the end is considered. Are we, in some sense, immortal? Would
                                    immortality be desirable? Also a
                                    clearer notion of what it is to die is examined. What does it mean to say that a
                                    person has died? What kind of
                                    fact is that? And, finally, different attitudes to death are evaluated. Is death an
                                    evil? How? Why? Is suicide
                                    morally permissible? Is it rational? How should the knowledge that I am going to die
                                    affect the way I live my
                                    life?

                                <li>Before asking, &quot;do I survive?&quot;, it is important to ask, &quot;who am
                                    I&quot;. Or more generally, what
                                    is a person? The second thing we need to be clear about is, what is the concept of
                                    surviving? <em>What does it
                                        mean when a person existing today exists at some other time in the future?</em>
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                                <li>
                                    <p>Here, we have two objections. If death is defined as the end of life, then asking
                                        whether there is more life
                                        after death is &quot;stupid&quot;. Thus, there couldn&#39;t possibly be life
                                        after death. Maybe now, we
                                        ought to ask the question in a different manner, &quot;might I survive my
                                        death?&quot; Again, the answer is
                                        no, surviving is the act of not dying when you were supposed to. Kind of in a
                                        twist here.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>What happens when a body dies? Forgetting the initial cause that set&#39;s in the
                                        condition of death. We
                                        usually have the following things happen: oxygen stops moving through the body,
                                        cells don&#39;t metabolize
                                        anymore, blood doesn&#39;t circulate, the body stops repairing damage, decay
                                        sets in, yada yada. This entire
                                        sequence is a characteristic of <strong>bodily death</strong>.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Next question, do I still exist after the abovementioned - in graphic detail -
                                        bodily death. The answer could
                                        be <em>nyet</em> but it&#39;s not obviously <em>no</em>. Now that we sorted out
                                        these nitty-gritty details,
                                        we&#39;ll just ask, &quot;Is there life after death&quot; instead of messing
                                        around with words.</p>

                                    <p>What kind of an entity is a person? One answer is that a person = body +
                                        something else that is separate,
                                        immaterial and distinct from the body (people like using the word <em>soul</em>
                                        to describe the latter
                                        part). This is the dualist view.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>The monoist view is, as the name suggests, the idea that a person is just a body.
                                        And it&#39;s a special sort
                                        of physical object which can do all sorts of crazy things (think, play footy
                                        etc). Another monoist view is
                                        idealism, the idea that all that exists is the soul and the body is just an
                                        illusion that we entrap
                                        ourselves in.</p>

                                    <p>The soul directs the body and body generates input that is felt by the soul.
                                        <em>Where is the soul located in
                                            space by the way?</em> The attraction of this view is that, once the body is
                                        non-functional, the soul
                                        still exists. So, maybe death is the severing of the connection between the body
                                        and the soul.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>Suppose that a person = body + soul. Now, once the body dies, by definition, the
                                        person dies. Ergo, in order
                                        for the concept of life after death to have validity, we need the person to be
                                        strictly defined by only the
                                        soul. The first question with regards to this point is whether souls and bodies
                                        are actually distinct. And
                                        secondly, does the soul survive the destruction of the body? And if it survives,
                                        how long does it survive?
                                        Forever? Am I immortal?</p>

                                    however, is not just any body.
                                    It is a very sophisticated body. My pencil is a body which is less sophisticated

                                    <p>The dualist would say here that there are in fact, two qualities to emotions. One
                                        is the behavioural aspect
                                        of feeling emotions, where we react to situations and plan accordingly. Another
                                        is the &quot;feeling&quot;
                                        aspect, what&#39;s happening on the inside? The machines work very well
                                        behaviourally but not the feeling
                                        part. For example a blind scientist could know that an apple was much redder
                                        than a tomato (using a light
                                        frequency reader or something) but never feel the colour red.</p>

                                    <p>No machine could have qualia, or qualitative experience. That&#39;s a pretty good
                                        objection. For a
                                        physicalist to respond to this, they would have to provide a recipe for building
                                        a machine that can have
                                        qualitative experience. Unfortunately, we aren&#39;t anywhere close to doing
                                        that. We don&#39;t know enough
                                        about consciousness yet.</p>

                                    <p>The dualist is standing on some pretty high ground but the height is just an
                                        illusion. True, the soul theory
                                        has a better explanation. But it is not even an explanation of consciousness. It
                                        just says consciousness is
                                        just due to a soul and runs out of points. It&#39;s no better than not having a
                                        soul. The jury&#39;s still

                                        states that given a certain initial conditions and input, the machine or system
                                        <strong>will</strong> end up
                                        at a known final state via known paths. All purely physical systems are subject
                                        to determinism. And so it
                                        follows that we are not a purely physical system.

                                        life. If these people have not
                                        died permanently, how can their experiences count for anything. The objection is
                                        also, quite stupid. You
                                        don&#39;t invalidate a person&#39;s experience of Norway because they didn&#39;t

                                    <p>Imagine a scenario where one fine day, you get up from bed and go to brush your
                                        teeth. You look at the mirror
                                        and don&#39;t see your reflection, you look down at yourself and see nothing.
                                        What&#39;s more, you don&#39;t
                                        even feel any sensation in your body. Is this an imagination of your body
                                        ceasing to exist? We&#39;re
                                        thinking clearly, we&#39;re experiencing strong emotions, namely fear (I guess
                                        panic is the right term) and
                                        yet, our body doesn&#39;t exist.</p>
                                </li>

                                    <p>Descartes says that this thought experiment is enough to show that there is
                                        clearly something beyond the
                                        body. Because after all, we just imagined existing without our body. If we tell
                                        a story in which A exists
                                        and B does not exist, it follows that A and B are quite different things. And
                                        thus, it means our minds and
                                        bodies are quite different.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>It is important to understand here that the argument is not saying that since we
                                        can imagine unicorns,
                                        unicorns exist. It only says that imagining one thing without the other gives a
                                        reason for believing that
                                        the two are not the same. We can&#39;t imagine a smile without any accompanying
                                        body parts but Descartes
                                        says it is quite easy to imagine the mind without a body.</p>

                                    <p>It&#39;s quite hard to provide a counter-example to Descartes&#39; conjecture
                                        because it&#39;s hard to pin
                                        down where it went wrong. One one hand, we can argue that imagination is not a
                                        substitute for possibility
                                        checks. In other words, our imagination needn&#39;t be correct. On the other
                                        hand, isn&#39;t imagination our
                                        greatest weapon while fathoming the mysterious?</p>

                                    <p>Here&#39;s my two cents worth as to where this fails, *the argument that if
                                        something can be imagined, then
                                        it is logically possible is nonsense. This is trivial since we have no concept
                                        of the mind except an
                                        intuitive one, rooted in language. This argument is allowed only because of our
                                        ability to equivocate on the
                                        word, not because of knowledge of it -- i.e. the argument is built upon our
                                        ignorance of these matters, not
                                        knowledge of them. <strong>Also, how do you see without a body? How does your

                                        happiness arises from the fact that he believes in a good heaven and an immortal
                                        soul. Socrates says that
                                        the soul can think and all other emotions like happiness, anger etc are the jobs
                                        of the body. The soul can

                                        that the final separation (death) can be viewed as an entry into heaven where we
                                        can spend all our time

                                    <p>Why can&#39;t the body grasp the Platonic forms? This is the second objection
                                        raised in the dialogue. An
                                        answer can be provided here, ideas and forms are eternal/nonphysical. That which
                                        is eternal can only be
                                        grasped by the eternal. This implies that whatever grasps the forms is
                                        definitely non physical (not the
                                        body) and eternal (which means the soul is eternal and will not get destroyed by
                                        the separation.) <em>Is the
                                            second assumption really true that only eternal entities can grasp eternal

                                        in nature. In a similar vein, the argument states that the soul existed long

                                        would ever feel like it is Feynman himself. What if I showed you a picture of
                                        someone you never met? In that
                                        case, you wouldn&#39;t have any recollection whatsoever. We need prior
                                        acquaintance and then we recollect.

                                    <p>We all recognize platonic forms, but they aren&#39;t physical objects. Plato says
                                        that certain objects in the
                                        physical world remind us of platonic forms. We&#39;ve never encountered perfect
                                        justice, perfect circularity
                                        etc in this life. So it must have existed before. The soul must have existed
                                        before our birth.</p>

                                    helps, but is it necessary? We come across things that are bent, some are straighter
                                    and some look really
                                    straight in this life. Can&#39;t we extrapolate from there?</li>

                                    <p>Reminder from where I left off, we don&#39;t really need a memory of perfect
                                        forms for us to think about
                                        them. We could have an idea of an incomplete or an imperfect form and
                                        extrapolate from there. And even if
                                        this premise is true, it only shows that the soul existed before death and says
                                        nothing or close to nothing
                                        about what happens to it after death.</p>

                                    <p>Aha, but by saying that, we have forgotten our earlier argument about recycling.
                                        So, if we assume that the
                                        soul is also recycled like all other atoms in the body, the soul also has to
                                        exist after death. <em>Okay, in
                                            vein of all the cynicism running rampant throughout this thought process,

                                            doesn&#39;t decay after death? In other words, immortality of the soul
                                            isn&#39;t answered by just giving
                                            it&#39;s states before birth and after death.</em></p>

                                    <p>How do we know the soul can&#39;t come apart? Here, Socrates starts a discussion
                                        about the kinds of things
                                        that can break and the kinds of things that cannot. Things that have parts can
                                        be destroyed, cars, books,
                                        bodies, trees etc. The number 7 can&#39;t be destroyed, the name and form could
                                        be, but the abstract concept
                                        cannot be touched.</p>
                                </li>

                                    <p>The argument from Socrates is as follows: only composite things can be destroyed.
                                        Only changing things are
                                        composite and invisible things don&#39;t change. This means that invisible
                                        things can&#39;t be destroyed.
                                        Since the soul is invisible, it follows that it is eternal. <em>Why don&#39;t
                                            invisible things change? Why
                                            can&#39;t they be destroyed.</em></p>

                                    <p>Cebes pipes in now, even if the soul is indestructible, it doesn&#39;t guarantee
                                        immortality. Socrates
                                        doesn&#39;t answer this.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Simmias says that invisible things can be destroyed. He gives an example of the
                                        harmony of a harp, it is
                                        invisible but some careless tuning will destroy the harmony. Again, Socrates
                                        doesn&#39;t answer this. He
                                        spends some time wondering whether we could compare harmony to a soul which is a
                                        stupid thing to do because
                                        even if he proved his point, it still remains that harmony is invisible. The
                                        correct thing to do here is to
                                        argue that harmony isn&#39;t invisible.</p>

                                    <p>Using harmony is a great weapon for physicalists here. Because the argument
                                        essentially states that perfect
                                        harmony arises out of the perfect state of the harp and not anything alien.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>When we were asking whether invisible things could be destroyed, we need to
                                        understand invisibility. The
                                        first interpretation is that anything that can&#39;t be seen is invisible,
                                        second, anything that cannot be
                                        observed. And third, can&#39;t be detected. I hope the difference is clear. I
                                        think Socrates meant
                                        interpretation number 2 when he was talking about invisibility. Harmony no
                                        longer works as a
                                        counter-example.</p>

                                    that the soul can&#39;t be detected? It ain&#39;t, we detect souls every day, all

                                    <p>Plato suggests that in order to be destroyed, you need to have parts. So, does
                                        the soul have parts? is it
                                        changeable? Also, there is no reason to suggest that the soul is simple. In the
                                        <em>Republic</em>, Plato
                                        himself argues that there are three parts, a rational part, spiritual part and
                                        one responsible for appetite.

                                    <p>And if the soul is simple, it doesn&#39;t follow that it is indestructible.
                                        Breaking apart something is not
                                        the only way to destroy something. The soul could very well just go out of

                                    <p>The analogy is characteristic of the physicalists. Harmony clearly cannot exist
                                        before the existence of the
                                        harp itself. Also, harmony can vary. We can have varying degrees of
                                        &quot;soulfulness&quot;. The soul could
                                        be good/evil, and similarly, certain harmonies are good/bad.</p>

                                        its harmony. Maybe the harp is too simple a machine to have a good analogy. If

                                        Simmias, we could say that plucking two or more strings together is a way of

                                        essential property is a property
                                        that the object needs to have while the latter is a property that isn&#39;t
                                        really necessary for the
                                        existence of the object. The paint of a car is a contingent property and the
                                        engine is an essential
                                        property.</p>

                                    <p>Here&#39;s an essential property for the soul according to Plato, whenever
                                        there&#39;s a soul, it is alive.
                                        By alive, he means that it is capable of thought. We don&#39;t like minds that
                                        aren&#39;t capable of
                                        thinking. He says that life is an essential property of the soul and that means
                                        that the soul can&#39;t be
                                        destroyed and hence, it is deathless.</p>

                                    <p>The part where is goes wrong is <strong>deathless</strong>. What does it mean to
                                        say that something is
                                        deathless? One possibility is that the soul can&#39;t exist and be dead at the
                                        same time. Another
                                        possibility is that the soul can&#39;t be destroyed. What&#39;s the difference?

                                    <p>The first interpretation just means what it says but the stronger question is
                                        posed by the second
                                        interpretation. If Plato can convince us that the soul is indestructible, we are
                                        set.</p>

                                        out to do it ourselves and wander throughout wherever unicorns could be. And on

                                    <p>What does it mean to survive? Existence in multiple points of time? Suppose

                                        years from now, could that be you? Is that the same person as you are? What does

                                    <p>One way to go wrong here is to say things like, &quot;The person isn&#39;t the
                                        same, he&#39;s bald and bent

                                        across time. One example that
                                        Kagan gives is of a train, when we&#39;re at the end of the train and point at
                                        the train, it is quite
                                        different from when we&#39;re at the beginning of the train and point towards
                                        the engine. Even though
                                        they&#39;re the same train, they look quite different. So by pointing, we&#39;re
                                        pointing at the whole
                                        extended space occupied by the train and not a single carriage.</p>

                                    <p>Now, imagine a yard where they take the trains in for inspection and maintenance.
                                        While walking across the
                                        tracks, we come across the end of a train and after a while, we see the engine
                                        on the other side. Since we
                                        cannot see through the yard, we don&#39;t know if the end and engine are
                                        connected or they&#39;re actually

                                    <p>Consider a brand new car bought in 2020, by 2030, it doesn&#39;t look so good and
                                        by 2040, it&#39;s probably
                                        not even working. But when we talk about the car, we refer to the same thing.
                                        Here, we&#39;re referring to
                                        an extended block of time that the car is occupying. Let&#39;s say we sell the
                                        car in 2030 and get a new
                                        one. Now, while driving past a dump in 2035, we see a car that looks a lot like
                                        our old car, but we
                                        can&#39;t really tell if it&#39;s our car because of the same issue from the

                                        the glue that joins up the space-time worm? In the case of trains, it&#39;s the
                                        links between carriages. In
                                        the case of cars, what makes a 2020 car the same as a 2022 car?</p>

                                        wear out the seats, the steering wheel etc. So what should a car have to
                                        convince us that. How many changes
                                        of the constituent parts could we have and still be the same car? He doesn&#39;t

                                    <p>Now, we have a framework for thinking about people across time. Are people glued
                                        together in time. What is
                                        the metaphysical glue? Suppose there&#39;s a person X in 2020 and he&#39;s
                                        lively and fun until 2040, then
                                        he dies in 2041. What does it mean for X to survive his death? It means, in
                                        2042, could there be a somebody
                                        who&#39;s part of the very same space-time worm that X occupied. We can only
                                        answer this question if
                                        we&#39;re clear about the metaphysical glue.</p>

                                    <p>One argument: the metaphysical key to having the same identity is to have the
                                        same soul. That&#39;s the kinda
                                        thing a dualist would say. For physicalists, the prospect of death and life
                                        after it doesn&#39;t seem so
                                        attractive now. Suppose that next week, while you&#39;re sleeping, by some
                                        strange turn of events, your soul
                                        gets replaced and this new soul has all your memories, desires etc. You wake up
                                        and say, &quot;Great
                                        morning, I&#39;m so and so&quot;. But according to the soul view, you&#39;re not
                                        you. Your soul has been
                                        switched. You&#39;d be wrong and none the wiser about it. How do you it already

                                    <p>We&#39;re not rejecting the soul theory here, we&#39;re just asking whether using
                                        the sameness of souls to
                                        justify the continued temporal existence of man is right. Another way to go
                                        about identifying the same
                                        person is to ask whether they have the same body. Just like we did for cars,
                                        same body same person without
                                        getting too much into the details.</p>

                                    <p>So at first glance, the question, will I survive the death of my body? gives us
                                        an obvious no. But there is a
                                        logical possibility of me surviving the death of my body, all it takes is for
                                        someone to put my body back.
                                        Logically possible.</p>

                                    <p>The important question here is, when someone puts back our body after we die, is
                                        that still our body? Suppose
                                        we take our phone to the repair guy because it stopped working, the repair guy
                                        takes it apart, cleans it and
                                        puts it back. Lo and behold, my phone&#39;s working again. No one&#39;s going to
                                        say, &quot;hey, that
                                        ain&#39;t mine!&quot; There was a time when the phone was disassembled when he
                                        was cleaning it, it was
                                        &quot;dead&quot; at that time, and now it&#39;s back and fine.</p>

                                    <p>An excellent counter argument coming up, so brace thyselves. Suppose my friend
                                        wrote a very huge program that
                                        could solve sudoku on my laptop for an contest because his was broken. He goes
                                        to sleep all excited about
                                        presenting it the next day. I am browsing around and I permanently delete his
                                        files by mistake. As expected,
                                        I panic and code the entire thing from scratch exactly as he did. I even get the
                                        line numbers and variable
                                        names correct. The next day, my friend gets all gung-ho about the contest where
                                        he wants to present
                                        <strong>his</strong> code. But is it though? The point is that putting back an
                                        object doesn&#39;t make it
                                        the original object.

                                        one not a good example. And
                                        then, we need to check whether the phone example is closer to what happens to
                                        the body than the tower.

                                        that some parts of the body aren&#39;t as important as the others. Losing some
                                        tummy fat doesn&#39;t make
                                        you a different person, losing an arm doesn&#39;t make you a different person,
                                        so what does? Is the most

                                        compatible with being a physicalist. And also with dualists. Even if our soul
                                        changes every second, as long
                                        as our personality doesn&#39;t change, we&#39;re the same person. But even the
                                        personality changes. So maybe
                                        we just require enough gradual overlap.</p>

                                    <p>Haha, we&#39;re not done. What if Einstein, after having lived all his life died
                                        peacefully and woke up one
                                        day morning in the south of Bangalore. Then it&#39;s not wrong to say that this
                                        person, granted with his
                                        other memories isn&#39;t Einstein. This stuff is science fiction, but if this
                                        reincarnation works, then is
                                        the personality theory correct?</p>

                                        of the personality theory. We
                                        need to talk about branching/splitting of the human soul. So, we throw in a
                                        no-branching clause. What this
                                        means is that in cases where there aren&#39;t any multiple possessions, we
                                        accept that Einstein is alive in
                                        a new body, but if there are claims of multiple possessions, we say Einstein is
                                        dead.</p>

                                        existence right now depends
                                        solely on whether anyone else is not claiming to be me. I&#39;m not prepared to
                                        accept this incoherent chain
                                        of thought and I will stick with my body theory.</p>

                                        true? Not really, at a fundamental level, bodies come about via duplication or
                                        splitting. Suppose we had
                                        Alice&#39;s left hemisphere put into Bob&#39;s torso and her right hemisphere

                                    <p>Looking at all this, the soul-theorists are laughing. Does the soul avoid the

                                        fission? Possibility number one is that souls, just like bodies and
                                        personalities can split. We hit the
                                        no-branching rule again.</p>

                                        survive the millenium. But
                                        according to the personality theory, it is still me, because the personality was

                                        Let&#39;s go onto more pressing issues now.</p>

                                        perspective, Death means
                                        that the body is broken and cannot function properly anymore. So, which
                                        functions are crucial in defining
                                        the moment of death? The easy answer is to say that death happens when both the
                                        personality and the body
                                        stop functioning.</p>

                            <p>The lecture explores the question of the state of being dead. Even though the most
                                logical claim seems to be that
                                when a person stops P-functioning he or she is dead, a more careful consideration must
                                allow for exceptions, such as
                                when one is asleep or in a coma. Professor Kagan then suggests that on some level nobody
                                believes that he or she is
                                going to die. As a case in point, he takes Tolstoy&#39;s famous character Ivan Ilych.

                                    <p>Maybe the right thing to ask is not whether the person is p-functioning at that
                                        time but to ask whether
                                        he/she can. If you wake a person up, they can sing, dance and do math. Whereas,
                                        when we are dead, we
                                        aren&#39;t able to engage in doing theoretical physics.</p>

                                    <p>Take someone in a coma, they aren&#39;t engaging in p-functioning, but can they?
                                        How do we get them out of
                                        the coma in the first place? But <strong>if</strong> we could get them out of
                                        the coma, they would go back
                                        to doing normal things. The other side of the fence here is if the brain has
                                        gotten all soupy during the
                                        long coma and it&#39;s of no use trying to revert them.</p>

                                        metabolic processes stop.
                                        <em>This reminds me of Heinrich Himmler&#39;s doctor who performed some
                                            absolutely gruesome experiments on
                                            humans out in the cold</em>. This suggests the need of a third category
                                        outside of death and life,
                                        let&#39;s call it Schrodinger. We need some more information to distinguish
                                        between Schrodinger and being
                                        alive, how do we get that information?

                                        argument is that it is impossible for things to happen if we can&#39;t imagine

                                        don&#39;t exist if we
                                        can&#39;t imagine them. We can picture being ill, we can maybe imagine the
                                        moment of our death, but not
                                        being dead.</p>

                                        there is something to imagine and we can&#39;t imagine. There is seriously
                                        nothing to imagine there. No
                                        mystery. Similarly, there is no mystery in imagining death. There is nothing
                                        happen to be imagine. So our

                                his views on mortality. All of his life he has known that death is imminent but has
                                never really believed it. When
                                he suddenly falls ill and is about to die, the fact of his mortality shocks him. In

                                of arguments against it and ends by considering whether the primary badness of death
