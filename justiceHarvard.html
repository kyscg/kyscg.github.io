                            <p><em>The "Justice: What is the right thing to do?" lectures were my first introduction to
                                    concepts of philosophy and various theories of justice. This blog post is a
                                    collection of the notes I scribbled while listening to the lectures, one every day.
                                    There is no obvious structure to the notes other than what I managed to get after
                                    typing everything, the results can be seen on the contents bar. In a nutshell,
                                    Michael Sandel explains theories around
                                    justice, morality and ethics. In order to do so, he starts with a case study to
                                    juxtapose different theories of justice and morality. For example, the <a

                            <p>The only way to leave the state of nature is by an act of <strong>consent</strong> where
                                we all agree to give up the
                                enforcement power and to create a government / community where there will be a
                                legislature to make law and where
                                everyone agrees in advance to abide by what the <strong>majority</strong> decides.</p>

                            <h3 id="section-7"><a href="#section-7">What can the majority decide?</a></h3>

                            <p>Remember that the majority cannot decide on your life, liberty and property. So,
                                there&#39;s a dilemma here. On one hand, we&#39;d like the problem of property rights to
                                be resolved but on the
                                other hand, we all know that the majority cannot decide on the life, liberty and
                                property of individuals as it would
                                mean undermine the inherent principle of self-possession.</p>
                            <p>Property is natural in one sense but conventional in another, it&#39;s natural in the
                                sense that we have a
                                fundamental unalienable right, that the <strong>institution of property</strong> exist
                                and be respected by the
                                government. But what counts as taking up property is defined by the government.</p>

                            <p>According to Immanual Kant, when we, like animals, seek pleasure or the satisfaction of
                                desires or the avoidance of
                                pain, we aren&#39;t really acting freely, we&#39;re acting as the slaves of those
                                appetites. <em>Personally, I
                                    couldn&#39;t agree more. Freedom is not choosing Twitter and McDonalds over
                                    Instagram and KFC, it is not needing
                                    to choose any of them at all.</em></p>
